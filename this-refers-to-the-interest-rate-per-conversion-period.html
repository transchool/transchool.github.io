</strong></p><p>An investment earns 3% compounded monthly. Find the value of an initial investment of $5,000 after 6 years.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Solution
</strong></p><p>Determine what values are given and what values you need to find.
</p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p>Earns 3% compounded monthly: the rate is r=0.03 and the number of times compounded each year is m=12
</p><p>Initial investment of $5,000: the initial amount is the principal, <strong>P=5000
</strong></p><p>6 years: <strong>t=6
</strong></p><p>You are trying to find A, the future value (the value after 6 years). Now apply the formula with the known values:
</p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>A=P(1+rm)mt=5000(1+0.0312)12×6≈5984.74
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Answer: </strong>The value after 6 years will be <strong>$5,984.74.</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>The statement:</strong> It refers to the interest rate per conversion period.</p><p>Based on the options given, it refers to: <strong>A. COMPOUND INTEREST.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>FURTHER EXPLANATION:</strong></p><p>There are differences in the <strong>types</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>interest</strong> or the development of the savings itself. For example regarding the single flower that you have studied before. The single interest calculation is calculated from the initial capital, and without being accumulated to the following periods. So that the amount of interest generated is the same each period. Now, unlike single interest, other types of interest, namely compound interest, have different calculations.</p><p></p><p>In principle, the compound interest is given based on the <strong>initial</strong> <strong>capital</strong> and the <strong>accumulation</strong> of the interest from the previous period, so the amount of interest for each period is not the same. So we can conclude that the compound interest is interest that is calculated based on the the initial principal, which also includes all accumulated interest from previous deposits or  the loans. In simple terms, when you save your money at a bank, with compound interest rates, the calculation of the interest you will receive is the initial capital of your savings, plus the accumulated interest that you also get in each period.</p><p></p><p>Learn more about <strong>the effective interest rate equal to the nominal interest rate:</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/20528831</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />
