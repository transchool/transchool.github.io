                                            Terry’s Tempting Gifts has been in operation for 11 years. Terri and her late husband Tom opened the small business investing most of their personal savings. Tom died suddenly a little over one year ago. Terry, age 53, continues to operate the business. She plans to do so until her retirement in about ten years. Terry has three grown children who live out of state. They visit several times a year but have no plans on taking over the family operation.When the business first opened Tom and Terry prepared a lengthy business plan to secure bank financing to accompany their personal savings. Tom managed the day-to-day operations of the store while Terry selected merchandise and waited on most of the customers. Terry continues to attend market twice a year purchasing the most up-to-date merchandise for the store.Terry‘s Tempting Gift is located in a small community of approximately 5,800 people. The town has three major employers: a small manufacturing plant employing 125 people, a medium-security state-operated prison employing 115 people, and a meat processing plan employing 80 people. The store is located from 9:00am to 5:00pm six days a week. Two big display windows face the post office. Terry is proud of the fact that she changes the window displays promptly on the first of each month. The store offers a wide selection of small, unique gifts along with the assortment of silk flowers and helium balloons. A major retail chain store is located on the edge of the city next to the community’s only supermarket .the closest real competitor for Terry is located in a shopping mall approximately 80 miles away. Two local florists offer a wide selection of silk flower arrangements. They also deliver balloons with their floral arrangement upon request. Regular customers know they can find the “perfect” gift if they shop at Terry’s Tempting Gifts. As a service to her patrons, Terry will gift-wrap and deliver anywhere in town free of charge. Local customers can charge their purchases. Currently Terry has accounts receivable of about 200,000.00php. Customers are served promptly since seven part-time employees rotate shifts in the store. Terry tries to keep four part-time employees working each day. Lately several people have commented that Terry spends a lot of time in the local coffee shop about one block from the store. Terry visits the coffee shop three times each day and always slips a few dollars out of the cash register before each trip to pay for her coffee and snacks. Terry feels that advertising is very important to the image of the store. Tom used to coordinate a promotion each month. Terry just takes the easy approach now and buys advertising from either the local newspaper or radio station- depending upon which salesperson walks through the door first each week.As Terry opened the mail today, she received two notices from suppliers that she is behind on her payments. Her bank note of 22,500php is due next week. She only has eight more bank payments to make and her loan will be paid off, leave the store debt free except for current obligations. The part-time employees must be paid at the end of the week. Terry looks at the business check book and realizes that she barely has enough money to cover the expenses this week. She starts to worry about next week.What recommendations do you have for Terry and for the future operations of Terry’s Tempting Gifts?Give atleast 4 recommendations​</a>

                                            Case analysis:Arlene and Rochelle dined at a restaurant in Iloilo which is very famous because of its excellent local food and incomparable hospitality. Finding the restaurant was an easy thing to do as it is very near a popular mall ang is in proximity to other areas like hotels, market, and other shopping centers. As they approach the restaurant, they were immediately welcomed and greeted with warm smiles from the staff. After asking how many they are in the group, Sheryl, the food attendant, pulled out each chair and made sure that everyone was comfortably seated. right after, she gave the menu to each of the members of the group and gladly mentioned their specialties of the day. AS Ariane and Rochelle, together with the other members of the group, are already hungry, they immediately ordered food. In no less that 15 minutes, the food was delivered impeccably. Sheryl rushed over, making sure that the food was a specialty of the region. As another set of food was delivered to the table, Sheryl was hesitant, to disturb. So, what she did was to grab the rice platter and offered it to the person in the group whose appetite was very good. She emptied the platter to him/her, and the person was really elated as this is not a usual thing for a food attendant to do, but still she thought of the idea so that she can now place the next dish on the table. The group ended up very much delighted of the food and the service that Sheryl and her colleagues provided them. Arlene and Rochelle, now very much grateful, shared their experience to their friends and relatives, reminding them to always make a stop in this restaurant whenever they are in the region.From this scenario, answer the following questions using 2-3 sentences each.1.  As an employee, how was the delivery of customer service of Sheryl?2. As a customer, are the factors that you appreciate on the service of the restaurant and factors that you don't appreciate when there's any?3. Were the customer's expectations met? How?​</a>

Here is the perfect system for cleaning your room. First, move all of the items that comhave a proper place to the center of the room. Get rid of at least five things that you have not used witthe last year.

For any remaining items, see youcan squeeze them in under your bed or stuff them into the back of your doset See, that was easy!2. Oceans and lakes have much in common, but they are also quite different. Both are bodiesof water, but oceans are very large bodies of salt water, while lakes are much smaller bodies of freshwater. Lakes are usually surrounded by land, while oceans are what surround continents. Both have plantsand animals living in them. The ocean is home to the largest animals on the planet, whereas lakes supportmuch smaller forms of life. When it is time for a vacation, both will make a great place to visit and enjoy3. I haven't been to Bali, Indonesia, but I have read about it. I have been to Boracay Island,that's why I know these two tourist destinations are similar in many ways. Both are small islands that havefive beachers, hillside terraces and cool green hills. Bali and Boracay boast of international cuisinesbecausepeople from all over the world visit them. However, Bali's beaches are golden while those of Boracay arewhite and the sand is fine as powder. A village in bali is famous for its golden and silver work. There is noneof this in Boracay. There is a cultural center in Bali called Ubud. On the other hand, there are only shopswhere you can buy goods that are very Filipino in Boracay.4. I do well in school, and people think I am smart because of it. But it's not true. In fact, threeyears ago I struggled in school. However, two years ago I decided to get serious about school and made afew changes. First, I decided I would become interested in whatever was being taught, regardless of whatother people thought. I also decided I would work hard every day and never give up on any assignment. 1decided to never, never fall behind. Finally, I decided to make school a priority over friends and fun. Afterimplementing these changes, I became an active participant in classroom discussions. Then my test scoresbegan to rise. I still remember the first time that someone made fun of me because "I was smart." Howexciting! It seems to me that being smart is simply a matter of working hard and being interested. After all,learning a new video game is hard work even when you are interested. Unfortunately, learning a new videogame doesn't help you get into college or get a good job.5.

                                            BUYER BEHAVIOUR AND RELATIONSHIP DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH COMPANY TRIES TO SHOW THAT YOU CAN ONLY UNDERSTAND CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR BY LIVING WITH THEIR BEHAVIOUR How can any marketer get inside your mind to understand how you actually make purchase decisions? Structured questionnaire surveys may have a role for collecting large scale factual data, but they have major weaknesses when it comes to understanding individuals' attitudes. Qualitative approaches, such as focus groups can get closer to the truth, but participants often still find themselves inhibited from telling the full story. Many marketing managers, especially those without large research budgets, inevitably end up relying on their own personal experiences to understand how consumers behave. This may be easy for target markets which are in the 20-40 age range (the age of typical marketers), but how do you get inside the mind of teenagers, or elderly people? Ethnographic approaches are becoming increasingly popular among marketers as a means of getting closer to the truth about consumer behaviour. Ethnographic research is nothing new, having been used by anthropologists in their study of the rituals of tribal people. Marketers have been relatively recent converts to the techniques of ethnography. The advertising agency BMP DDB has taken on board the techniques of ethnography in its "Project Keyhole" in a manner which is reminiscent of anthropologists' practice of living with tribes in order to understand them. Its consumer researchers live with a family for several days in order to record their every move. The project is designed to meet the needs of client companies who are looking for more than the data gathered using traditional quantitative and qualitative research techniques. Participants record their views and actions on a digital video camera, in the presence of a researcher who stays with them from 8am until 10pm for a few days.A normal project would last four or five days and the client may be invited along for part of the time. Participants are paid £100 for their troubles. What did they do with the direct mail when it came through the letter box? Did they use the coupon offer which it contained? Who drinks the fresh orange juice in the house? How long do they spend cooking dinner? How do they actually cook the ready-prepared meals they bought earlier? Does the family eat together? These are examples of the vital information that sponsoring companies hope to get hold of in order to position their products more effectively. According to the company, the advantage of this method over conventional research is that it picks up inconsistencies between what people say they are doing and what they actually do. Following them throughout the day allows the researcher to see why a person's habits might change according to random factors such as their mood, the time of day or the weather. Crucially it reveals the quirks in our behaviour that marketers are desperate to gain an insight into. For example, a person's store-card data might tell you that they buy bread and margarine, but it doesn't tell whether they eat the bread fresh, or toast it first before putting margarine on it. In 1998, the magazine Marketing put this novel research method to the test with a guinea pig family called the Jones's. It then compared the results of this approach with more traditional methods of profiling customers. In short, established systems such as CACI, Claritas and Experian might say one thing about the buying behaviour of a family, using lifestyle and electoral roll data, but did they bear any relation to reality? The information that the researcher gathered in a short space of time told a lot about the Jones family. By contrast, the database information about the Joneses, although detailed and often accurate, could not capture the quirks and details that make up the personality of the family. For example, it transpired that the Joneses had a keener than average eye on value for money. Although information on them from the four database companies correctly suggested that they enjoy luxuries like good food and foreign holidays, it didn't say anything about the real life factors that influence their purchasing decisions. The most noticeable of these was that although they like good food, Mrs Jones mixed her shopping between the supermarket and a local discount store which sells cut-price brands. This means that she only bought at Tesco or Sainsbury's what she could not get cheaper elsewhere. She showed the researcher a can of branded plum tomatoes which she got for 10p at the discount store as an example, explaining that it would have cost 26p in the supermarket. Mrs Jones prided herself on being able to hunt down bargains like this and occasionally rewarded herself by buying "something luxurious", such as smoked salmon from Marks &amp; Spencer. ​</a>

                            4. Terry’s Tempting Gifts has been in operation for 11 years. Terri and her late husband Tom opened the small business investing most of their personal savings. Tom died suddenly a little over one year ago. Terry, age 53, continues to operate the business. She plans to do so until her retirement in about ten years. Terry has three grown children who live out of state. They visit several times a year but have no plans on taking over the family operation.When the business first opened Tom and Terry prepared a lengthy business plan to secure bank financing to accompany their personal savings. Tom managed the day-to-day operations of the store while Terry selected merchandise and waited on most of the customers. Terry continues to attend market twice a year purchasing the most up-to-date merchandise for the store.Terry‘s Tempting Gift is located in a small community of approximately 5,800 people. The town has three major employers: a small manufacturing plant employing 125 people, a medium-security state-operated prison employing 115 people, and a meat processing plan employing 80 people. The store is located from 9:00am to 5:00pm six days a week. Two big display windows face the post office. Terry is proud of the fact that she changes the window displays promptly on the first of each month. The store offers a wide selection of small, unique gifts along with the assortment of silk flowers and helium balloons. A major retail chain store is located on the edge of the city next to the community’s only supermarket .the closest real competitor for Terry is located in a shopping mall approximately 80 miles away. Two local florists offer a wide selection of silk flower arrangements. They also deliver balloons with their floral arrangement upon request. Regular customers know they can find the “perfect” gift if they shop at Terry’s Tempting Gifts. As a service to her patrons, Terry will gift-wrap and deliver anywhere in town free of charge. Local customers can charge their purchases. Currently Terry has accounts receivable of about 200,000.00php. Customers are served promptly since seven part-time employees rotate shifts in the store. Terry tries to keep four part-time employees working each day. Lately several people have commented that Terry spends a lot of time in the local coffee shop about one block from the store. Terry visits the coffee shop three times each day and always slips a few dollars out of the cash register before each trip to pay for her coffee and snacks. Terry feels that advertising is very important to the image of the store. Tom used to coordinate a promotion each month. Terry just takes the easy approach now and buys advertising from either the local newspaper or radio station- depending upon which salesperson walks through the door first each week.As Terry opened the mail today, she received two notices from suppliers that she is behind on her payments. Her bank note of 22,500php is due next week. She only has eight more bank payments to make and her loan will be paid off, leave the store debt free except for current obligations. The part-time employees must be paid at the end of the week. Terry looks at the business check book and realizes that she barely has enough money to cover the expenses this week. She starts to worry about next week.What recommendations do you have for Terry and for the future operations of Terry’s Tempting Gifts?Give atleast 4 recommendations​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>For Terry to continue the operation of the Gift Shop, she has to do the following:</p><p></p><p>•	<strong>VENTURE TO PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES</strong></p><p>Since Terry visits the coffee shop often and slips cash out of her pocket as payment, it could be possible to make a deal with the owner. She can probably link her gift shop business to the coffee shop operation, through giving gift certificates or promos to the coffee shop goers. Promo would include: Drink one cup of coffee and get a free gift-wrap in Terry’s Tempting Gifts or 5% off in Terry’s Tempting gift items.  </p><p></p><p>•	<strong>MANAGE HER ACCOUNTS (PAYABLES &amp; RECEIVABLES)</strong></p><p>It would be very fitting that she’ll manage her accounts so that she wouldn’t live in debt.</p><p></p><p>•	<strong>DECIDE TO ONLY HAVE 2 WORKERS</strong></p><p>Fewer workers will mean that her payable will decrease. Noting that she’s always available to attend her shop, the shop will still function smoothly even with just a little help from her part-time workers.</p><p></p><p>•	<strong>SCOUT ON THE ITEMS SOLD IN THE COMPETING STORE</strong></p><p>Know then scout for items sold in the competing store. This will give her good ideas on what to sell and invite more customers.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> Operating a gift shop is always a hard job. You need to up to update your stuff and be crafty. Also, you need to know the style of your competitors in order to survive in the business competition. Promotional activities are also very important.</p><p></p><p><strong>For more relative info, please check the link below:</strong></p><p>https://koronapos.com/blog/how-to-run-a-successful-gift-shop/</p><br />

Finding the restaurant was an easy thing to do as it is very near a popular mall ang is in proximity to other areas like hotels, market, and other shopping centers. As they approach the restaurant, they were immediately welcomed and greeted with warm smiles from the staff. After asking how many they are in the group, Sheryl, the food attendant, pulled out each chair and made sure that everyone was comfortably seated. right after, she gave the menu to each of the members of the group and gladly mentioned their specialties of the day. AS Ariane and Rochelle, together with the other members of the group, are already hungry, they immediately ordered food. In no less that 15 minutes, the food was delivered impeccably. Sheryl rushed over, making sure that the food was a specialty of the region. As another set of food was delivered to the table, Sheryl was hesitant, to disturb. So, what she did was to grab the rice platter and offered it to the person in the group whose appetite was very good. She emptied the platter to him/her, and the person was really elated as this is not a usual thing for a food attendant to do, but still she thought of the idea so that she can now place the next dish on the table. The group ended up very much delighted of the food and the service that Sheryl and her colleagues provided them. Arlene and Rochelle, now very much grateful, shared their experience to their friends and relatives, reminding them to always make a stop in this restaurant whenever they are in the region.From this scenario, answer the following questions using 2-3 sentences each.1.

Oceans and lakes have much in common, but they are also quite different. Both are bodiesof water, but oceans are very large bodies of salt water, while lakes are much smaller bodies of freshwater. Lakes are usually surrounded by land, while oceans are what surround continents. Both have plantsand animals living in them.

I haven't been to Bali, Indonesia, but I have read about it. I have been to Boracay Island,that's why I know these two tourist destinations are similar in many ways. Both are small islands that havefive beachers, hillside terraces and cool green hills. Bali and Boracay boast of international cuisinesbecausepeople from all over the world visit them. However, Bali's beaches are golden while those of Boracay arewhite and the sand is fine as powder. A village in bali is famous for its golden and silver work. There is noneof this in Boracay. There is a cultural center in Bali called Ubud. On the other hand, there are only shopswhere you can buy goods that are very Filipino in Boracay.4.

However, two years ago I decided to get serious about school and made afew changes. First, I decided I would become interested in whatever was being taught, regardless of whatother people thought. I also decided I would work hard every day and never give up on any assignment. 1decided to never, never fall behind. Finally, I decided to make school a priority over friends and fun. Afterimplementing these changes, I became an active participant in classroom discussions. Then my test scoresbegan to rise. I still remember the first time that someone made fun of me because "I was smart." Howexciting! It seems to me that being smart is simply a matter of working hard and being interested.

                            13. BUYER BEHAVIOUR AND RELATIONSHIP DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH COMPANY TRIES TO SHOW THAT YOU CAN ONLY UNDERSTAND CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR BY LIVING WITH THEIR BEHAVIOUR How can any marketer get inside your mind to understand how you actually make purchase decisions? Structured questionnaire surveys may have a role for collecting large scale factual data, but they have major weaknesses when it comes to understanding individuals' attitudes. Qualitative approaches, such as focus groups can get closer to the truth, but participants often still find themselves inhibited from telling the full story. Many marketing managers, especially those without large research budgets, inevitably end up relying on their own personal experiences to understand how consumers behave. This may be easy for target markets which are in the 20-40 age range (the age of typical marketers), but how do you get inside the mind of teenagers, or elderly people? Ethnographic approaches are becoming increasingly popular among marketers as a means of getting closer to the truth about consumer behaviour. Ethnographic research is nothing new, having been used by anthropologists in their study of the rituals of tribal people. Marketers have been relatively recent converts to the techniques of ethnography. The advertising agency BMP DDB has taken on board the techniques of ethnography in its "Project Keyhole" in a manner which is reminiscent of anthropologists' practice of living with tribes in order to understand them. Its consumer researchers live with a family for several days in order to record their every move. The project is designed to meet the needs of client companies who are looking for more than the data gathered using traditional quantitative and qualitative research techniques. Participants record their views and actions on a digital video camera, in the presence of a researcher who stays with them from 8am until 10pm for a few days.A normal project would last four or five days and the client may be invited along for part of the time. Participants are paid £100 for their troubles. What did they do with the direct mail when it came through the letter box? Did they use the coupon offer which it contained? Who drinks the fresh orange juice in the house? How long do they spend cooking dinner? How do they actually cook the ready-prepared meals they bought earlier? Does the family eat together? These are examples of the vital information that sponsoring companies hope to get hold of in order to position their products more effectively. According to the company, the advantage of this method over conventional research is that it picks up inconsistencies between what people say they are doing and what they actually do. Following them throughout the day allows the researcher to see why a person's habits might change according to random factors such as their mood, the time of day or the weather. Crucially it reveals the quirks in our behaviour that marketers are desperate to gain an insight into. For example, a person's store-card data might tell you that they buy bread and margarine, but it doesn't tell whether they eat the bread fresh, or toast it first before putting margarine on it. In 1998, the magazine Marketing put this novel research method to the test with a guinea pig family called the Jones's. It then compared the results of this approach with more traditional methods of profiling customers. In short, established systems such as CACI, Claritas and Experian might say one thing about the buying behaviour of a family, using lifestyle and electoral roll data, but did they bear any relation to reality? The information that the researcher gathered in a short space of time told a lot about the Jones family. By contrast, the database information about the Joneses, although detailed and often accurate, could not capture the quirks and details that make up the personality of the family. For example, it transpired that the Joneses had a keener than average eye on value for money. Although information on them from the four database companies correctly suggested that they enjoy luxuries like good food and foreign holidays, it didn't say anything about the real life factors that influence their purchasing decisions. The most noticeable of these was that although they like good food, Mrs Jones mixed her shopping between the supermarket and a local discount store which sells cut-price brands. This means that she only bought at Tesco or Sainsbury's what she could not get cheaper elsewhere. She showed the researcher a can of branded plum tomatoes which she got for 10p at the discount store as an example, explaining that it would have cost 26p in the supermarket. Mrs Jones prided herself on being able to hunt down bargains like this and occasionally rewarded herself by buying "something luxurious", such as smoked salmon from Marks &amp; Spencer. ​</h2><br />
