                                            Case Study: Jenns Barr Construction Supply Miss Jennilyn Barrientos is currently trying hard to make a decision on whether or not she would continue her construction supply business. Jennilyn was raised by her parents as a God-fearing and descent person. She does not fail to go to church every Sunday. She graduated valedictorian at the La Salette High School. The University of Santo Thomas awarded her a diploma in Business Administration with highest honors. It was while studying in UST when she met Jefferson, a townmate who was also enrolled in the College of Engineering of the same university. He courted her and after sometime, she agreed to marry him one year after graduation. On the day of the nuptial, Jefferson did not appear. Jennilyn felt humiliated, but after a few months of desperation, she bounced back and got a job in a commercial bank. Two years later, she was promoted supervisor and after a year she became the manager of the branch. She began to think that a job in a bank does not provide her with enough opportunities to prove her real worth. She entertained thoughts about operating a small business. She resigned from the bank and started to make moves to effectively operate a construction supply business. Jennilyn’s parents own a vacant 1,000 square meter lot at the edge of the town’s business district. Directly in front of the national highway and its back is the city road. The place is an ideal site for a construction supply business. Her parents agreed to construct a building to house her business on the condition that she would pay rent. Just a month after she started operating, her assistant informed her of the need to convince a top rated contractor to buy from them. Jennilyn agreed to meet him. A few days later, when Jennilyn was in her office, her assistant came rushing to inform her the prospect has arrived to meet her. Jennilyn was shocked when she saw that the potential customer was her former boyfriend. Jefferson shook her hand and asked how she was. She tried hard to hide displeasure and said she’s fine. They talked for a few minutes and then he left. Once more, Jennilyn felt a rising anger within her. She wants to avoid the guy, so she is considering shifting to another type of business like that of drug wholesaling or hospital supplies. Guide Questions What would be your advice to Jennilyn? Does she need to shift to another type of business?​</a>

                            15. Case Study: Jenns Barr Construction Supply Miss Jennilyn Barrientos is currently trying hard to make a decision on whether or not she would continue her construction supply business. Jennilyn was raised by her parents as a God-fearing and descent person. She does not fail to go to church every Sunday. She graduated valedictorian at the La Salette High School. The University of Santo Thomas awarded her a diploma in Business Administration with highest honors. It was while studying in UST when she met Jefferson, a townmate who was also enrolled in the College of Engineering of the same university. He courted her and after sometime, she agreed to marry him one year after graduation. On the day of the nuptial, Jefferson did not appear. Jennilyn felt humiliated, but after a few months of desperation, she bounced back and got a job in a commercial bank. Two years later, she was promoted supervisor and after a year she became the manager of the branch. She began to think that a job in a bank does not provide her with enough opportunities to prove her real worth. She entertained thoughts about operating a small business. She resigned from the bank and started to make moves to effectively operate a construction supply business. Jennilyn’s parents own a vacant 1,000 square meter lot at the edge of the town’s business district. Directly in front of the national highway and its back is the city road. The place is an ideal site for a construction supply business. Her parents agreed to construct a building to house her business on the condition that she would pay rent. Just a month after she started operating, her assistant informed her of the need to convince a top rated contractor to buy from them. Jennilyn agreed to meet him. A few days later, when Jennilyn was in her office, her assistant came rushing to inform her the prospect has arrived to meet her. Jennilyn was shocked when she saw that the potential customer was her former boyfriend. Jefferson shook her hand and asked how she was. She tried hard to hide displeasure and said she’s fine. They talked for a few minutes and then he left. Once more, Jennilyn felt a rising anger within her. She wants to avoid the guy, so she is considering shifting to another type of business like that of drug wholesaling or hospital supplies. Guide Questions What would be your advice to Jennilyn? Does she need to shift to another type of business?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My advice to her is to be professional. She is in the field of business and personal issues should be disregarded when it comes to business. Also she only started her business so, no, she doesn't need to shift. </p><p></p><br />
