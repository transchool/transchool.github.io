Informal words are often casual and spontaneous. For instance, the word 24/7 is often used to refer to a business entity so to make it more formal the word nonstop or unending can be use. To cook up is to prepare something while epic when expressed might mean something extravagant especially when referring to adventure. Burning the midnight oil is an idiom which means work overtime.

Informal words are often casual and spontaneous. For instance, the word 24/7 is often used to refer to a business entity so to make it more formal the word nonstop or unending can be use. To cook up is to prepare something while epic when expressed might mean something extravagant especially when referring to adventure. Burning the midnight oil is an idiom which means work overtime. Romcom is an abbreviated word for romantic comedy.</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> formal tone, informal tone, idioms</p><p>Example of Formal Word: <strong>https://brainly.ph/question/408372</strong></p><p><strong>#LearnWithBrainly</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The issue of who is responsible for children’s physical health is complex, with implications for targeting and developing strategies for health promotion and interventions to improve health. While there is evidence to suggest that children are able to construct notions of responsibility in relation to other areas of their lives, very little research has explored children’s views of responsibility for their own health. The aim of this study was to explore children’s views about who they feel is responsible for keeping them healthy.</p><p></p><p></p><br />
