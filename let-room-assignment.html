                                            2. How to vote on election day in 12 easy steps Step 1: Go to your assigned polling precinct from 6 am to 5p.m. on May 9 The Commission on Election (Comelec) advises voters to come early and not wait until the last minute. Look for your name in the voters list posted near the precinct. The Parish Pastoral Council for Responsible Voting (PPCRV) voter's assistance desk in the polling place can also help you look for your precinct, sequence, and room number. Step 2: Fall in line in the holding area Step 3: Give your name, valid I.D., and precinct number to the Board of Election Inspectors (BEls) Step 4: Get your ballot, ballot secrecy folder, marker, and go to the voting area Make sure your ballot is clean of any marks, Step 5: Vote wisely Under voting and abstaining is allowed; overvoting is not. If you overvote, the vote will not be counted. Shade the entire oval corresponding to your candidate of choice. Cover your ballot using the ballot secrecy folder, even the poll watchers and BEI cannot look at your ballot. Do not make any other marks on the ballot Step 6: Feed your ballot into the vote-counting machine The machine has a green check button that casts your vote and a red "X" button that returns your ballot. If you don't press either in one second, the machine automatically casts your ballot and prints a receipt. Step 7: Return the ballot secrecy folder and marker Step 8: Wait for your receipt to print and let the precinct supervisor cut your receipt from the machine Do not tear or pull the voter's receipt because it can cause the entire roll of thermal paper to be yanked, which may cause the vote-counting machines (VCMs) to temporarily shut down. The BEI will cut the receipt using a pair of scissors. www.shsph.blogspot.com 10 Step 9: Have your right forefinger marked with indelible ink Step 10: Take your voter's receipt and verify your vote Step 11: Drop the receipt in the receptacle beside the VCM provided by Comelec, Step 12: Leave the polling precinct Answer: Category- Explanation:​</a>

                            17. 2. How to vote on election day in 12 easy steps Step 1: Go to your assigned polling precinct from 6 am to 5p.m. on May 9 The Commission on Election (Comelec) advises voters to come early and not wait until the last minute. Look for your name in the voters list posted near the precinct. The Parish Pastoral Council for Responsible Voting (PPCRV) voter's assistance desk in the polling place can also help you look for your precinct, sequence, and room number. Step 2: Fall in line in the holding area Step 3: Give your name, valid I.D., and precinct number to the Board of Election Inspectors (BEls) Step 4: Get your ballot, ballot secrecy folder, marker, and go to the voting area Make sure your ballot is clean of any marks, Step 5: Vote wisely Under voting and abstaining is allowed; overvoting is not. If you overvote, the vote will not be counted. Shade the entire oval corresponding to your candidate of choice. Cover your ballot using the ballot secrecy folder, even the poll watchers and BEI cannot look at your ballot. Do not make any other marks on the ballot Step 6: Feed your ballot into the vote-counting machine The machine has a green check button that casts your vote and a red "X" button that returns your ballot. If you don't press either in one second, the machine automatically casts your ballot and prints a receipt. Step 7: Return the ballot secrecy folder and marker Step 8: Wait for your receipt to print and let the precinct supervisor cut your receipt from the machine Do not tear or pull the voter's receipt because it can cause the entire roll of thermal paper to be yanked, which may cause the vote-counting machines (VCMs) to temporarily shut down. The BEI will cut the receipt using a pair of scissors. www.shsph.blogspot.com 10 Step 9: Have your right forefinger marked with indelible ink Step 10: Take your voter's receipt and verify your vote Step 11: Drop the receipt in the receptacle beside the VCM provided by Comelec, Step 12: Leave the polling precinct Answer: Category- Explanation:​</h2><br />
