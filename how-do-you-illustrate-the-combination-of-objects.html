                        <strong>COMBINATION</strong><p><strong></strong></p><p>1. How would you<strong> determine if the situation involves a combination?</strong></p><p><strong>A combination</strong> is a choice made from among several options, where the sequence in which the choices are made is irrelevant.</p><p></p><p>Combinations first deal with counting a variety of items. There is a permutation or combination suggestion in problems involving selection. Picking things up from a box of balls, choosing students in a class, and other word problems frequently include selection.</p><p></p><p>Combination differs from permutation in that the order in which the items are chosen is irrelevant. This is crucial since not all problems make it clear when order is irrelevant.</p><p></p><p>In a combination problem, the important thing is whether something is picked or not (vs. the order). If the order at which something is picked is important, the problem deals with permutation. Usually, if there are specific things associated with the order of picking, those are permutations and not combinations.</p><p></p><p>2. How do you <strong>illustrate the combination</strong> of objects?</p><p><strong>The combination is dealt with</strong>, for instance, when three students are chosen to form a "cleaners" group in a class. This is due to the fact that the order in which pupils are selected has no bearing. The students chosen are Student A, Student B, and Student C. The identical thing would happen if Student B, Student C, and Student A were chosen. The student body has not changed.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, permutation is involved in selecting the officers, the President, Vice President, and Secretary, from a class. It is different for Student B to become president, Student C to become vice president, and Student A to become secretary than for Student B to hold those positions. The pupils are still from the same group, but they received different materials. Since what they received is specific, it does not constitute a combination.</p><p></p><p>3. For you, what is<strong> the most convenient method</strong> to use?​</p><p><strong>Using combination formula. </strong></p><p>The combination formula aids in determining the number of possible combinations that can be created by selecting a portion of a bigger set of objects. It demonstrates how many distinct subsets are feasible given the larger collection. It should be noticed that the below-mentioned permutation and combination formulas are connected.</p>nCr = [tex]\frac{n!}{(n-r)!r!}[/tex]<p>where:</p><p>Each permutation's size is r, and the size of the set from which it is drawn is n. Both r and n are non-negative integers. is used as a factorial operator.</p><p></p><p>Learn more about <strong>combination</strong> here:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/17403275</p><p>#SPJ6</p><br />
