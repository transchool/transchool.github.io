A photon is the smallest (7)particleof electromagnetic radiation. These particles travel in waves.Light travels in straight lines called rays. Light travels "at the speed of light." Thisspeed is about 186,000 miles per second (670 million miles per hour), or about 300,000"speed limit." So far,kilometers per second. The speed of light is sort of a (8)nothing has been found that can travel faster than light.Light can travel in a vacuum. A vacuum is empty space. There are no molecules of airor anything else in a vacuum. Like all forms of electromagnetic waves, light can travel throughempty space, as well as through matter.​</a>

In Science class, Jennie's teacher asked them to group themselves into five for an experiment about properties of matter. They have learned that the ability of materials to absorb water is due to the presence of loose fibers with lots of pores or holes between the particles that make the materials. Examples of materials that absorb water are tissue paper, cottons, and cloth; they are called porous materials. On the other hand, materials that do not absorb water or liquid are called non-porous materials, examples of which are plastic or metal spoons, porcelains, cups, and glasses.that is for grade 5 not grade 3 or 4 ok</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>plastic, polymeric material that has the capability of being molded or shaped, usually by the application of heat and pressure. This property of plasticity, often found in combination with other special properties such as low density, low electrical conductivity, transparency, and toughness, allows plastics to be made into a great variety of products. These include tough and lightweight beverage bottles made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), flexible garden hoses made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), insulating food containers made of foamed polystyrene, and shatterproof windows made of polymethyl methacrylate.</p><br />

A photon is the smallest (7)particleof electromagnetic radiation. These particles travel in waves.Light travels in straight lines called rays. Light travels "at the speed of light."

                            27. learning task 1:Jennie is a fourth grader at Simeon R. Bendañia Sr. Memorial Elementary School. In Science class, Jennie's teacher asked them to group themselves into five for an experiment about properties of matter. They have learned that the ability of materials to absorb water is due to the presence of loose fibers with lots of pores or holes between the particles that make the materials. Examples of materials that absorb water are tissue paper, cottons, and cloth; they are called porous materials. On the other hand, materials that do not absorb water or liquid are called non-porous materials, examples of which are plastic or metal spoons, porcelains, cups, and glasses.that is for grade 5 not grade 3 or 4 ok</h2><br />

                            30. LEARNING ACTIVITY SHEETS Changes in Materials HA Directions: After reading about physical and chemical properties, identify what property is possessed by the sample materials listed below. Sample Material Property Fire wood has the chemical properly of bi Plammability Firewood and mc al The main characteristic of glass are Transparency heat resistance and breavage resistance Pressure resistance the harness of plot glass is etabilished acording to knoop Glass bottle Gasoline er Bandgrade 5​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>FirewoodThe mechanical properties of wood include strength in tension and compression (as measured in axial and transverse directions), shear, cleavage, hardness, static bending, and shock (impact bending and toughness).Glass bottleThe main characteristics of glass bottle are transparency, heat resistance, pressure and breakage resistance and chemical resistance.CanThe cans intended to contain food must have the strength and robustness to allow handling, filling and processing, storage and distribution without damage. The most delicate moment of a container is during the sterilization process to which it is subjected once filled and closed.GasolineThe most important properties of gasoline fuels are properties such as volatility and knocking resistance, whereas diesel fuels are required to have important fuel properties such as viscosity, surface tension, and ignition tendency.Rubber BandElasticity: The molecular structure of rubber materials allows them to return to their normal shape after being compressed or stretched. This characteristic is apparent in rubber bands. Stretching or compressing a rubber band temporarily pulls or pushes the individual molecules out of alignment with each other.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainliest po :)</p><p>thanks me later</p><p></p><br />
