                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Multimedia refers to the use of multiple forms of media, such as text, images, audio, and video, to convey information and ideas. It has become an essential tool for disseminating information, raising awareness, and promoting advocacies in various fields, including education, health, and environmental conservation.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>One of the key advantages of multimedia is its ability to engage and captivate audiences. By combining different forms of media, multimedia can create a rich and immersive experience that engages the senses and captures the attention of the audience. This is particularly useful for conveying complex or abstract ideas, as it allows the audience to better understand and retain the information.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Another advantage of multimedia is its ability to reach a wide and diverse audience. With the proliferation of digital technologies, multimedia can be easily accessed and shared via the internet, allowing it to reach a global audience. This is particularly useful for raising awareness and promoting advocacies, as it allows organizations and individuals to reach a large number of people and engage them in their causes.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>An example of the use of multimedia in disseminating information and raising awareness is the "Together" campaign by the World Health Organization (WHO). The campaign uses a combination of text, images, and videos to raise awareness about the importance of mental health and the need to address mental health disorders. The campaign uses multimedia to create a compelling and engaging experience that reaches a global audience and promotes the WHO's advocacy for mental health.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>In conclusion, the use of multimedia is an effective way of disseminating information, raising awareness, and promoting advocacies. By engaging and captivating audiences, and reaching a wide and diverse audience, multimedia can help to create a more informed and aware society</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

Why?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.)Social advocacy refers to the actions of brand advocates who publicly share information related to their experiences with a company or their perceptions of the business's brand identity. The term social advocacy can also be used to describe shared efforts to address widespread, systemic issues in society</p><p></p><p>2.)Advocacy … promotes equality, social justice and social inclusion. It can empower people to speak up for themselves. Advocacy can help people become more aware of their own rights, to exercise those rights and be involved in and influence decisions that are being made about their future</p><p></p><p>Advocacy seeks to ensure that all people in society are able to: Have their voice heard on issues that are important to them. Protect and promote their rights. Have their views and wishes genuinely considered when decisions are being made about their lives</p><p></p><p>3.)Media advocacy is the use of any form of media to help promote an organization's or a company's objectives or goals, which come from the group's vision and mission. For example, suppose you’re a media advocate for a non-profit agency working to reduce gang violence in your neighborhood. You would try to present neighborhood issues related to gang violence and the changes you want to make in such a way that you:</p><p></p><p>Change the way community members look at gang violence. You might want to make it clear who it affects and why, or why kids get involved in gangs in the first place.</p><p>Create a reliable, consistent stream of publicity for your agency's issues and activities, including articles and news items about the causes and results of gang violence and about what your agency’s work entails; personal interest stories; success stories; interviews with agency staff and current and former gang members, etc..</p><p>Motivate community members and policy makers to get involved.  You probably have ideas about what could be done with public funding, or with government policies that addressed gang violence. You might have volunteer opportunities, or want to publicize a city- or state-sponsored initiative that needs public input and support.  Or perhaps you’re trying to raise money for your work. The media can help with all of these...if you know how to work with them.</p><p>Media advocates, or the people who work to attract publicity for organizations and causes, know that the media can get a public or social policy message across to the largest audience possible in the least amount of time.</p><p></p><p>4.)Advocacy can help your organization achieve its political goals whatever they may be, including: improving public services such as transportation, information, etc. education. ... new laws that better protect the civil rights associations, including the legal recognition and other civil society organizations</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>DAILY </strong><strong>REMINDER</strong><strong> </strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong><strong>JESUS </strong><strong>LOVES</strong><strong> YOU</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>There are numerous best practices for running an advocacy campaign because the campaigns can be so varied themselves.</p><p></p><p>To begin, try out these 8 best practices and see where they take your advocacy campaign:</p><p></p><p>1.Eight questions that will guide your advocacy strategy</p><p></p><p>2.Remember the relationship between online and offline activities.</p><p></p><p>3.Consider the impact.</p><p></p><p>4.Ensure your action step is front and center.</p><p></p><p>5.Contact in the best way possible.</p><p></p><p>6.Keep your friends close.</p><p></p><p>7.Be crystal clear.</p><p></p><p>8.Continuously grow your supporter list (9 ways).</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it helps :) </p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Ask your employees</p><p></p><p>Simply asking your employees what would help improve your working culture can lead to greater engagement and better recruitment and retention levels. Creating an online suggestion forum can yield many ways in which everyday life can be improved for staff. From free snacks, carpool boards, and Ping-Pong tables, to anti-discrimination training, management initiatives, and team away-days, small changes can make the world of difference to making your staff feel valued.</p><p></p><p>2. Create a Wall of Awesome</p><p></p><p>Dedicate the space in your office where you highlight the awesomeness of your employeesand allow other employees highlight their peers in fun ways.</p><p></p><p>At Sprinklr we go as far as creating our own official hashtag we use in internal conversations to spotlight someone's success. Ours is #PureAwesomeness. We also have a conference room called Awesomeness that always makes our employees and our clients smile.</p><p></p><p>When the company rebuilt its offices, leadership wanted to showcase the Sprinklr story and essence. Employees are what makes the company, so they dedicated the whole wall to employee photos. It is a nice representation of the diversity of the firm.</p><p></p><p>We also love to highlight the personalities of our employees on our social channels through "meet the team" posts. We are proud of the passionate people who work here and want to give a glimpse of who we are to our external tribe and our customers. Here is how our community management team shared my story on Twitter.</p><p></p><p>3. Celebrate success</p><p></p><p>It sounds so simple, but rewarding success can boost employee morale and lead to more positive word-of-mouth both internally and externally. It can also mean better customer service as employees know that they will be positively affected when the company does well, and therefore feel more genuinely involved in providing the best service to customers.</p><p></p><p>Rewarding success doesn't have to be about big bonuses; public recognition in the form of internal awards, or even praise in a team meeting can boost morale. Just saying, "Thank you" more often can go a long way towards helping staff feel appreciated.</p><p></p><p>Tony Hsieh, CEO of Zappos.com, a brand with one of the most loyal and engaged staff of any company, says that celebrations--both big and small--are a big deal at Zappos:</p><p></p><p>"We truly feel that celebrating frequently the things we achieve is one of the best motivators around for getting that kind of achievement repeated. While we rack up some pretty big bills for happy hours and parties, we believe that every one of those dollars comes back to us threefold in employee engagement, which to us is really what success is all about."</p><p></p><p>4. Rethink your pet policy</p><p></p><p>Our Sprinklr offices are also pet-friendly. Whenever you hear "aaawww" and "ooohhh, you are so adorable," you know that one of our hairy friends decided to do a lap around the office. Whether it is Oscar napping on top of the desk, or Bear dressed in the Halloween costume, they add a lot of lively energy to the otherwise routine day.</p><p></p><p>5. Allow for flexible schedules</p><p></p><p>One reliable way of improving employee morale, increasing productivity and improving relations between management and employees, is to offer flexible working hours. This could be anything from offering more part-time positions, job-shares, flexi-time (either with core hours or without), extended maternity and paternity leave, and working from home.</p><p></p><p>Some companies go as far as offering unlimited vacation. In this case, some employees take very little time, some take more than usual in any given year (always with a good reason or for a good cause). But companies that offer this benefit always comment on how much commitment, productivity, and energy this policy brings to their culture.</p><p></p><p>Advantages? Employees who feel trusted to manage their own time are often more loyal and work harder. The reputation for a good employment culture attracts more applicants and helps a company recruit the highest caliber employees.</p><p></p><p>A company is its employees. Staff with high levels of satisfaction perform well in their jobs and offer better customer service. Improving your business culture won't just benefit your employees: it will benefit your customers and ultimately, the organization as a whole.</p><p></p><p>Inc. helps entrepreneurs change the world.

A particular explanation may be very wide in nature - for instance, growing opportunity or fixing a destroyed political structure. For instance in 2008, U.S. official new kid in town Barack Obama utilized such an importance when he said, "this was the subsequent when we annihilated deterrents that have apportioned us for quite a while; when we empowered people of all social events and ages to a regular cause."Change.org and Causes are two notable locales that license people to orchestrate around a common explanation.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>What is an Advocacy https://brainly.ph/question/161843</p><p>#BRAINLYEVERYDAY</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            26. What do you think is the fastest way to promote an advocacy what king of multimedia would you suggest crafting it ?explain you answer</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Ask your employees
</p><p>Simply asking your employees what would help improve your working culture can lead to greater engagement and better recruitment and retention levels. Creating an online suggestion forum can yield many ways in which everyday life can be improved for staff. From free snacks, carpool boards, and Ping-Pong tables, to anti-discrimination training, management initiatives, and team away-days, small changes can make the world of difference to making your staff feel valued.
</p><p>
</p><p>2. Create a Wall of Awesome
</p><p>
</p><p>Dedicate the space in your office where you highlight the awesomeness of your employeesand allow other employees highlight their peers in fun ways.
</p><p>
</p><p>At Sprinklr we go as far as creating our own official hashtag we use in internal conversations to spotlight someone's success. Ours is #PureAwesomeness. We also have a conference room called Awesomeness that always makes our employees and our clients smile.
</p><p>
</p><p>When the company rebuilt its offices, leadership wanted to showcase the Sprinklr story and essence. Employees are what makes the company, so they dedicated the whole wall to employee photos. It is a nice representation of the diversity of the firm.
</p><p>
</p><p>We also love to highlight the personalities of our employees on our social channels through "meet the team" posts. We are proud of the passionate people who work here and want to give a glimpse of who we are to our external tribe and our customers. Here is how our community management team shared my story on Twitter.
</p><p>
</p><p>3. Celebrate success
</p><p>It sounds so simple, but rewarding success can boost employee morale and lead to more positive word-of-mouth both internally and externally. It can also mean better customer service as employees know that they will be positively affected when the company does well, and therefore feel more genuinely involved in providing the best service to customers.
</p><p>
</p><p>Rewarding success doesn't have to be about big bonuses; public recognition in the form of internal awards, or even praise in a team meeting can boost morale. Just saying, "Thank you" more often can go a long way towards helping staff feel appreciated.
</p><p>
</p><p>Tony Hsieh, CEO of Zappos.com, a brand with one of the most loyal and engaged staff of any company, says that celebrations--both big and small--are a big deal at Zappos:
</p><p>
</p><p>"We truly feel that celebrating frequently the things we achieve is one of the best motivators around for getting that kind of achievement repeated. While we rack up some pretty big bills for happy hours and parties, we believe that every one of those dollars comes back to us threefold in employee engagement, which to us is really what success is all about."
</p><p>
</p><p>4. Rethink your pet policy
</p><p>Our Sprinklr offices are also pet-friendly. Whenever you hear "aaawww" and "ooohhh, you are so adorable," you know that one of our hairy friends decided to do a lap around the office. Whether it is Oscar napping on top of the desk, or Bear dressed in the Halloween costume, they add a lot of lively energy to the otherwise routine day.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>5. Allow for flexible schedules
</p><p>One reliable way of improving employee morale, increasing productivity and improving relations between management and employees, is to offer flexible working hours. This could be anything from offering more part-time positions, job-shares, flexi-time (either with core hours or without), extended maternity and paternity leave, and working from home.
</p><p>
</p><p>Some companies go as far as offering unlimited vacation. In this case, some employees take very little time, some take more than usual in any given year (always with a good reason or for a good cause). But companies that offer this benefit always comment on how much commitment, productivity, and energy this policy brings to their culture.
</p><p>
</p><p>Advantages? Employees who feel trusted to manage their own time are often more loyal and work harder. The reputation for a good employment culture attracts more applicants and helps a company recruit the highest caliber employees.
</p><p>
</p><p>A company is its employees. Staff with high levels of satisfaction perform well in their jobs and offer better customer service. Improving your business culture won't just benefit your employees: it will benefit your customers and ultimately, the organization as a whole.
