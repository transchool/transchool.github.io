                                            Paul Churchland and Patricia Church Paul Churchland and Patricia Churchland, who are both neuroscientists, introduced eliminate materialism-"a radical claim that ordinary, common sense understanding of the mind is deeply wrong and that some or all of the mental states posited by common sense do not actually exist" (Ramsey, 2013). For them, it is false to daim that folk psychology, or common sense psychology, is the capacity to explain mental states of people. Most of people think that we have a stream of consciousness that contains images and conceptions of things about which we have beliefs and attitudes. Our beliefs and attitudes. Our beliefs and attitudes are supported by our feelings, which include mental states like joy and sorrow, or anxiety and relief. It is also a folk belief that our sense of the world and of ourselves is a direct representation of how the world is formed, thus making our bodies reflect or adapt the way the world is (Weed, 2011). The Churchlands argued that talk of mental states would eventually be abandoned in favor of a radically different view of how the brain works not identified with mental states. For them, self is nothing else but brain, or simply, the self is contained entirely within the physical brain. In Patricia Churchland's book Touching a Nerve: The Self as Brain (2013), she wrote: "My brain and I are inseparable. I am who I am because my brain is what it is. Even so, I often think about my brain in terms different from those I use when thinking about myself. I think about my brain as that, and about myself as me. I think about my brain as having neurons, but I think of me as having a memory. Still, I know that my memory is all about the neurons in my brain. Lately, I think about my brains in more intimate terms-as me." This supports the idea that to understand the self, one must study the brain, not just the mind.

                                            The chosen song is "Scars To Your Beautiful" by Alessia Cara
Explanation:
Title: Who I am
The song Scars to Your Beautiful by Alessia Cara is all about self-acceptance. It gives you the motivation that you do not need to undergo several surgeries and physical changes to be accepted by society. This is one of the songs in my gallery that I can relate to. It is not based on love stories like most of the emerging pop songs and rap anthems.
One of the lines that greatly hit me is "She craves, attention she praises, an image , She prays to be". I admit that sometimes I tend to get insecure with myself. Sometimes, I get jealous of individuals who are so physically attractive. I tend to be insecure and want to be more than who I am today. I want to achieve glowing skin, healthy and pearly white teeth, a clear face, and attractive eyelashes.
Even if this song will be out of the most popular songs in the market, it will still be one of my favorites because it helped me understand how to appreciate myself for who I really am. I know I am not the only one who can relate to this because in our present time, most people will see what is on the outside more than what is on the inside.</a>

                                            Performance Task 4. Directions: Read the news articles below. Take note of the important details to be able to fill out the table that follows. A. 3 nurses test positive for COVID-19 after getting vaccine Three nurses who received a Sinovac vaccine are now in quarantine after testing positive for COVID-19. Infectious Diseases Specialist, Dr. Rontgene Solante, explains an infection is still possible if the person had the virus a day or two before getting vaccinated or when exposed to the virus before the antibodies kicked in. Filipino Nurses United President Maristella Abenojar says the nurses got the Sinovac vaccine on March 1s and even administered vaccines or assisted in the immunization program. They were swabbed after a week and tested positive on March 9. They are asymptomatic. Dr. Solante explains that a person will only get some protection from the virus on the second week after vaccination. That's when the body would have started producing enough antibodies to help fight the infection. Almost 216,000 frontline health workers got the first dose of Sinovac and AstraZeneca vaccines. The Filipino Nurses United is calling for paid leave if they experience any side effect which could hinder them from working. Meanwhile, the Filipino Infectious Diseases Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology says pregnant women who are at high risk of exposure to COVID-19 infection as well as lactating mothers may receive a COVID-19 vaccine despite limited studies on its safety and efficacy, but this is still upon doctor's assessment and should only be offered to pregnant and breastfeeding women at high-risk groups such as frontline health workers and uniformed personnel. They recommend it during the second or third trimester of pregnancy. Doctors say those who have just given birth may also be vaccinated against COVID-19, but they must wait two weeks after receiving a different type of vaccine like anti-tetanus or flu shots. - Carolyn Bonquin. CNN Philippines, Mar. 17, 2021B. Duterte to China: PH won't withdraw ships from West Philippine Sea By: Krissy Aguilar - Reporter / @KAquilarINQ INQUIRER.net/01:35 PM May 14, 2021 MANILA, Philippines - President Rodrigo Duterte has declared that the Philippines will not withdraw its assets from the disputed parts of the West Philippine Sea while also insisting he does not intend to quarrel with China due to the country's "debt of gratitude" to them. "We have a stand here and I want to state it here and now again. Na yung mga barko natin nandyan ngayon sa Pag-asa at saan po, we will not move an inch backward." Duterte said in the second part of his taped speech aired Friday. (We have a stand here and I want to state it here and now again. That our ships are there in Pag-asa Island and somewhere else, we will not move an inch backward.) "Ayoko mokipagaway nga sa China, Inuulit ko, may utang ng loob kami. Malaki, malaki ang utang ng loob. Buhay ang tinulong nya sa amin. Pero yung ano naman ng bayan namin, sana maintindihan ninyo," he added, (I don't want to quarrel with China, I repeat, we have a debt of gratitude. A big one. They helped us with our lives. But I hope you understand the interest of our nation.) Duterte noted this is "what's supposed to be done by any president of any self-respecting republic." In the same televised speech, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana told Duterte the country's assets are deployed at the Kalayaan Island Group. "I'd like to put notice on China. May dalawang barko ako dyan...Sabihin ko sa China ngayon, as I said before, I am not ready to withdraw. I don't want a quarrel, I don't want trouble, I respect your position and you respect mine," Duterte said. (I have two ships there. Let me tell China now, as I said before. I am not ready to withdraw. I don't want a quarrel. I don't want trouble. I respect your position and you respect mine.) The President sold it is not wrong to admit that the Philippines is "inferior" in terms of "might and power." "Ngayon, hindi talaga ako aatras. Patayin mo man ako dito ako. Dito magtapos ang ating pagkakaibigan," he went on. (Now, I really won't withdraw. Even if you kill me. I will be here. This is when the friendship ends.) The Issuea.b. The Speaker's Standa.b.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> Assessment practices play an important role in the field of teaching. They not only show what students have learned but also provides vital information as to the effectiveness of a lesson, unit, or curriculum. A variety of assessment techniques must be used to determine student knowledge. Involving students in the assessment process helps them see how their knowledge has progressed and provides motivation and pride to push them on in their journey of obtaining knowledge.
</p><p>
</p><p>         Classroom assessments can be diagnostic, formative or summative.  At the beginning of a class, it would be useful to give students a quiz that would interpret each student’s favored learning style. This is where diagnostic assessment comes into play.  It is important to assess students frequently and with a variety of techniques to track progress. Formative assessments give me the evidence of student understanding.  Summative assessments are given at the end of a topic and show whether or not they have learned the content. Summative assessments tend to be a more substantial product.  The created product should reflect analysis, evaluation and synthesis of the information.  In this case, I will create a rubric that clearly shows the student what is expected. All assessments must be reliable and valid. The questions or activities used in an assessment must relate to the content that has been taught.

                            19. Paul Churchland and Patricia Church Paul Churchland and Patricia Churchland, who are both neuroscientists, introduced eliminate materialism-"a radical claim that ordinary, common sense understanding of the mind is deeply wrong and that some or all of the mental states posited by common sense do not actually exist" (Ramsey, 2013). For them, it is false to daim that folk psychology, or common sense psychology, is the capacity to explain mental states of people. Most of people think that we have a stream of consciousness that contains images and conceptions of things about which we have beliefs and attitudes. Our beliefs and attitudes. Our beliefs and attitudes are supported by our feelings, which include mental states like joy and sorrow, or anxiety and relief. It is also a folk belief that our sense of the world and of ourselves is a direct representation of how the world is formed, thus making our bodies reflect or adapt the way the world is (Weed, 2011). The Churchlands argued that talk of mental states would eventually be abandoned in favor of a radically different view of how the brain works not identified with mental states. For them, self is nothing else but brain, or simply, the self is contained entirely within the physical brain. In Patricia Churchland's book Touching a Nerve: The Self as Brain (2013), she wrote: "My brain and I are inseparable. I am who I am because my brain is what it is. Even so, I often think about my brain in terms different from those I use when thinking about myself. I think about my brain as that, and about myself as me. I think about my brain as having neurons, but I think of me as having a memory. Still, I know that my memory is all about the neurons in my brain. Lately, I think about my brains in more intimate terms-as me." This supports the idea that to understand the self, one must study the brain, not just the mind.

                            21. The chosen song is "Scars To Your Beautiful" by Alessia Cara
Explanation:
Title: Who I am
The song Scars to Your Beautiful by Alessia Cara is all about self-acceptance. It gives you the motivation that you do not need to undergo several surgeries and physical changes to be accepted by society. This is one of the songs in my gallery that I can relate to. It is not based on love stories like most of the emerging pop songs and rap anthems.
One of the lines that greatly hit me is "She craves, attention she praises, an image , She prays to be". I admit that sometimes I tend to get insecure with myself. Sometimes, I get jealous of individuals who are so physically attractive. I tend to be insecure and want to be more than who I am today. I want to achieve glowing skin, healthy and pearly white teeth, a clear face, and attractive eyelashes.
Even if this song will be out of the most popular songs in the market, it will still be one of my favorites because it helped me understand how to appreciate myself for who I really am. I know I am not the only one who can relate to this because in our present time, most people will see what is on the outside more than what is on the inside.</h2><br />

Most of my assignments are due atthe same time, and a lot of them are time-consuming. -Isabella Sandoval____________4. As a student, my online experiencehas been interesting. What I like about this experience isthat I have more time to talk to my family and call or textsome friends. I get to do school work from home and I havetime for self-care. I like that I kind of get to choose whichclasses 1 should work on first and which I could wait to doafter. -Brenda Hernandez___________5.

The feelings ofexcitement, love, and motivation, make me believe that itis okay to be in relationships while studying._________9. My experience with online learning isvery stressful and hard.

A. 3 nurses test positive for COVID-19 after getting vaccine Three nurses who received a Sinovac vaccine are now in quarantine after testing positive for COVID-19. Infectious Diseases Specialist, Dr. Rontgene Solante, explains an infection is still possible if the person had the virus a day or two before getting vaccinated or when exposed to the virus before the antibodies kicked in. Filipino Nurses United President Maristella Abenojar says the nurses got the Sinovac vaccine on March 1s and even administered vaccines or assisted in the immunization program. They were swabbed after a week and tested positive on March 9. They are asymptomatic. Dr. Solante explains that a person will only get some protection from the virus on the second week after vaccination. That's when the body would have started producing enough antibodies to help fight the infection. Almost 216,000 frontline health workers got the first dose of Sinovac and AstraZeneca vaccines. The Filipino Nurses United is calling for paid leave if they experience any side effect which could hinder them from working. Meanwhile, the Filipino Infectious Diseases Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology says pregnant women who are at high risk of exposure to COVID-19 infection as well as lactating mothers may receive a COVID-19 vaccine despite limited studies on its safety and efficacy, but this is still upon doctor's assessment and should only be offered to pregnant and breastfeeding women at high-risk groups such as frontline health workers and uniformed personnel. They recommend it during the second or third trimester of pregnancy. Doctors say those who have just given birth may also be vaccinated against COVID-19, but they must wait two weeks after receiving a different type of vaccine like anti-tetanus or flu shots. - Carolyn Bonquin. CNN Philippines, Mar. 17, 2021B. Duterte to China: PH won't withdraw ships from West Philippine Sea By: Krissy Aguilar - Reporter / @KAquilarINQ INQUIRER.net/01:35 PM May 14, 2021 MANILA, Philippines - President Rodrigo Duterte has declared that the Philippines will not withdraw its assets from the disputed parts of the West Philippine Sea while also insisting he does not intend to quarrel with China due to the country's "debt of gratitude" to them. "We have a stand here and I want to state it here and now again. Na yung mga barko natin nandyan ngayon sa Pag-asa at saan po, we will not move an inch backward." Duterte said in the second part of his taped speech aired Friday. (We have a stand here and I want to state it here and now again. That our ships are there in Pag-asa Island and somewhere else, we will not move an inch backward.) "Ayoko mokipagaway nga sa China, Inuulit ko, may utang ng loob kami. Malaki, malaki ang utang ng loob. Buhay ang tinulong nya sa amin. Pero yung ano naman ng bayan namin, sana maintindihan ninyo," he added, (I don't want to quarrel with China, I repeat, we have a debt of gratitude. A big one. They helped us with our lives. But I hope you understand the interest of our nation.) Duterte noted this is "what's supposed to be done by any president of any self-respecting republic." In the same televised speech, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana told Duterte the country's assets are deployed at the Kalayaan Island Group. "I'd like to put notice on China. May dalawang barko ako dyan...Sabihin ko sa China ngayon, as I said before, I am not ready to withdraw. I don't want a quarrel, I don't want trouble, I respect your position and you respect mine," Duterte said. (I have two ships there. Let me tell China now, as I said before. I am not ready to withdraw. I don't want a quarrel. I don't want trouble. I respect your position and you respect mine.) The President sold it is not wrong to admit that the Philippines is "inferior" in terms of "might and power." "Ngayon, hindi talaga ako aatras. Patayin mo man ako dito ako. Dito magtapos ang ating pagkakaibigan," he went on. (Now, I really won't withdraw. Even if you kill me. I will be here. This is when the friendship ends.) The Issuea.b. The Speaker's Standa.b.
