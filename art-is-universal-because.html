For me this is the easiest way, you can search some of it in Youtube if you dont have any CD's. </p><p></p><p>this is the method of english proficiency CD's:</p><p>you listen and follow</p><p>listen to the voice of the one who is speaking in the cd, he/she may speak any words with the correct pronunciation, now all you have to do is to follow her way of speaking. Do this in your free time, the more you do, the more you will be used to in speaking the english language better. </p><p></p><p>every morning you wake up, get the dictionary and read a single word and understand its meaning. </p><p></p><p></p><p>lastly.. all you have to do is to be confident and for sure you'll be okay</p><p>fighting..!</p><p></p><p>Im a highschool student by the way, and I  hope it helps.</p><br />

He continues to depict the country's various people and scenery.</p>Photographypractice of photographing and retaining images by recording light, either electronically with an image sensor or chemically with a light-sensitive material such as photographic film. It has several uses in science, industry, and business, as well as more direct uses in art, film and video creation, entertainment, hobbies, and mass communication.The art or method of creating pictures on a sensitive surface using radiant energy, particularly light .Importance of photographyAs a result, makes art less exclusive by allowing anybody to examine it regardless of their distance from the object photographed. It is without a doubt the most democratic art form since no other art form can readily and swiftly copy other art forms.The most important visual art form is photography. Photographs are both a direct record generated by the world and an interpretation created by the photographer's decisions, whether conscious or unconscious. To put it another way, pictures are both documents and works of art.ContrastThe most typical modifications are created by altering the image's tones or colors. Since the dawn of photography,<strong> contrast</strong> has been a crucial component. It's the amount of variation between the pieces that make up an image.The difference in brightness or color that distinguishes an item is called <strong>contrast</strong>. The difference in color and brightness of one item and other things within the same field of vision determines contrast in visual perception of the actual world. The human visual system is more sensitive to contrast than absolute brightness; humans can experience the environment in the same way despite of large variations in lighting throughout the day or from location to location. The <strong>contrast </strong>ratio, also known as dynamic range, is the measure of an image's maximum contrast.<p>all about photography</p><p>brainly.com/question/13600227</p><p>brainly.com/question/1462924</p><p>brainly.com/question/7459381</p><p>#BRAINLYEVERYDAY</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
