Imagined Community
An imagined community is a concept developed by Benedict Anderson in his
1983 book Imagined Communities, to analyze nationalism. Anderson depicts
a nation as a socially constructed community, imagined by the people who
perceive themselves as part of that group
The media also creates imagined communities, through usually targeting a mass
audience or generalizing and addressing citizens as the public. Another way that
the media can create imagined communities is through the use of images. The
media can perpetuate stereotypes through certain images and vernacular. By
showing certain images, the audience will choose which image they relate to the
most, furthering the relationship to that imagined community.
According to Anderson, creation of imagined communities became possible
because of "print capitalism". Capitalist entrepreneurs printed their books and
media in the vernacular (instead of exclusive script languages, such as Latin) in
order to maximize circulation. As a result, readers speaking various local dialects
became able to understand each other, and a common discourse emerged.
Anderson argued that the first European nation-states were thus formed around
their "national print-languages." Anderson presented that the first form of
capitalism started with the process of printing books and religious materials. The
process of printing texts in the vernacular started right after the moment when the
books printed in script languages, such as Latin saturated the elite market and also,
in the moment it was observed that just a small category of people were speaking it
and were part of the bilingual society. It is also important to remember that this
start of cultural and national revolution started around 1517 when Martin Luther
presented his views regarding the scripture texts and how population and people
should be able to read it in the comfort of their own homes and then in the
following years, between 1520-1540, more than a half of the books that where
printed in German translation had his name on. Moreover, the first European
nation-states that are presented to have formed around their "national print-
languages" are said to be found in the Anglo-Saxon region, nowadays England and
around todays Germany. Should also be taken in consideration the fact that not
only in the Western Europe this process of creating a nation was emerging, in a
few centuries most of the Europe nations had created their own national languages,
but still were using languages such as Latin, French or German, mostly the last
two, for political affairs.
Nationalism and imagined communities
According to Anderson's theory of imagined communities, the main causes of
nationalism are the movement to abolish the ideas of rule by divine right and
hereditary monarchy and the emergence of printing press capitalism ("the
convergence of capitalism and print technology... standardization of national
calendars, clocks and language was embodied in books and the publication of daily
newspapers")—all phenomena occurring with the start of the Industrial
Revolution. From this Anderson argues that in the presence and development of
technology people started to make differences between what means divine and
divinity and what really is history and politics, because initially the divine and the
history of society and politics was based on the existence of a common religion
that was a unification umbrella for all the people across Europe. With the
emergence of the printing press and also capitalism, people gained some sort of
national consciousness regarding the common values that bring those people
together. The Imagined Communities started with the creation of their own nation
print-languages that were spoken by each individual. That helped the development
of the first forms of known nation-states, who then created their own form of art,
novels, publications, mass-media, and communications.
While attempting to define nationalism, Anderson identifies three paradoxes:
"(1) The objective modernity of nations to the historians' eyes vs. their subjective
antiquity in the eyes of nationalists.
(2) The formal universality of nationality as a socio-cultural concept [and]
(3) the 'political' power of such nationalisms vs. their philosophical poverty and
even incoherence."
Anderson talks of Unknown Soldier tombs as an example of nationalism. The
tombs of Unknown Soldiers are either empty or hold unidentified remains, but
each nation with these kinds of memorials claims these soldiers as their own. No
matter what the actual origin of the Unknown Soldier is, these nations have placed
them within their imagined community.

                                            The Philippines’ COVID-19 Response: Securitising the Pandemic and Disciplining the Pasaway Karl Hapal (2021) Duterte has securitised COVID-19. This was achieved by fulfilling the three main elements of securitisation – the identification of an existential threat, emergency measures, and breaking free of rules. The securitisation of COVID-19 relied on framing the pandemic as war – a fight for the nation‟s survival. This was used to justify the draconian response by the government in an attempt to suppress the spread of the virus. This was primarily achieved by utilising and expanding the powers of the state‟s law enforcement apparatus. While Duterte has successfully securitised COVID-19, he has done so in a peculiar way. Duterte‟s securitising act relied on his populist rhetoric – a populist securitising act so to speak. Seen this way, Duterte‟s populist rhetoric served as the speech act that argued for and legitimised the securitisation of COVID-19. A key element of his populist securitising act was projecting the Philippines under siege by a sinister menace that may undermine the well-being of Filipinos. Duterte‟s populist securitising act invariably produced the pasaway archetype, an erring and bullheaded subject who, through its behaviour, became the embodiment of the virus‟ deadly qualities. Consequently, this was used to justify the intense policing and disciplining campaign against the pasaway. The war against COVID-19 turned into a war against the pasaway. The war against the pasaway is an attempt by the government to protect virtuous citizens from an unwanted and undesirable “other.” The disproportionate focus on the pasaway, however, is not only to mitigate its bullheaded behaviour. It is also informed by deep-seated class prejudices – the pasaway, in some ways, resembling the colonised and racialised other. The bifurcated narrative and the concomitant legitimisation of the use of the state‟s coercive power have long been used to produce, maintain, and reinforce societal divides. Beyond class, however, the underlying discourse that informed the production of the pasaway soon spread to other groups‟ perceived derailing of governmental efforts against the virus. In this sense, the pasaway became an empty signifier representing any other behaviour or actions deemed disagreeable. As an empty signifier, the campaign to address the pasaway extended to not only arresting bullheaded individuals but also to silence dissent. While the pasaway has become an encompassing pejorative term, it still relied on the bifurcated depiction of Filipino society and the need to save the virtuous from the errant. These dualist and oppositional narratives are, however, not new. They resemble what has informed and animated Duterte‟s campaigns against illegal drugs, criminality, corruption, oligarchy, communism, and so on. These narratives serve to present a bifurcated society, an existential threat, and an accompanying justification to pursue actions with force and haste in the name of social justice and national integrity. Take, for example, the war on drugs. Duterte depicted the widespread sale and use of illegal drugs as “a clear national security threat […] an invasion of a new kind […] [and] a war against our families and children” (Philippine Daily Inquirer, 2020). Moreover, Duterte was able to frame the war on drugs as a noble crusade to salvage the Filipino nation (Hapal, 2019). In this crusade, society is seen as composed of good people and of demons (demonyo). The role of the government (particularly law enforcement) is “predictably, like avenging angels, to eliminate the demons to protect society – in other words, to keep the integrity of the „thin blue line‟” (Jensen and Hapal, 2018: 49). In this sense, the war against COVID-19 may be understood in conjunction with Duterte‟s other “wars on […]” Amid the pandemic, the government relentlessly continued its war on drugs, criminality, and corruption; intensified its war against terrorism alongside the passage of the controversial Anti-Terrorism Law; and escalated its campaign to dismantle so-called oligarchs, ABS-CBN – the largest media network in the Philippines – as one of the casualties. These wars are being fought to address a clear and present threat to ensure the well-being and future of the nation. And, more importantly, it presents an enemy to vanquish. The war on COVID-19 had serious consequences. Through the archetype of the pasaway, the government has, wittingly or unwittingly, turned the Filipino people into the enemy. This came to be as the virus, initially conceived as an “unseen enemy” creeping to infect, kill, and upend the lives of Filipinos, took a corporeal form. In other words, COVID-19‟s deadly and devastating qualities were soon embodied with the bullheaded character of the pasaway. It became the enemy order and, consequently, the object of disciplining and punishment. pasagot namn sa nakakaalam maraming salamat​</a>

Imagined Community
An imagined community is a concept developed by Benedict Anderson in his
1983 book Imagined Communities, to analyze nationalism. Anderson depicts
a nation as a socially constructed community, imagined by the people who
perceive themselves as part of that group
The media also creates imagined communities, through usually targeting a mass
audience or generalizing and addressing citizens as the public. Another way that
the media can create imagined communities is through the use of images. The
media can perpetuate stereotypes through certain images and vernacular. By
showing certain images, the audience will choose which image they relate to the
most, furthering the relationship to that imagined community.
According to Anderson, creation of imagined communities became possible
because of "print capitalism". Capitalist entrepreneurs printed their books and
media in the vernacular (instead of exclusive script languages, such as Latin) in
order to maximize circulation. As a result, readers speaking various local dialects
became able to understand each other, and a common discourse emerged.
Anderson argued that the first European nation-states were thus formed around
their "national print-languages." Anderson presented that the first form of
capitalism started with the process of printing books and religious materials. The
process of printing texts in the vernacular started right after the moment when the
books printed in script languages, such as Latin saturated the elite market and also,
in the moment it was observed that just a small category of people were speaking it
and were part of the bilingual society. It is also important to remember that this
start of cultural and national revolution started around 1517 when Martin Luther
presented his views regarding the scripture texts and how population and people
should be able to read it in the comfort of their own homes and then in the
following years, between 1520-1540, more than a half of the books that where
printed in German translation had his name on. Moreover, the first European
nation-states that are presented to have formed around their "national print-
languages" are said to be found in the Anglo-Saxon region, nowadays England and
around todays Germany. Should also be taken in consideration the fact that not
only in the Western Europe this process of creating a nation was emerging, in a
few centuries most of the Europe nations had created their own national languages,
but still were using languages such as Latin, French or German, mostly the last
two, for political affairs.
Nationalism and imagined communities
According to Anderson's theory of imagined communities, the main causes of
nationalism are the movement to abolish the ideas of rule by divine right and
hereditary monarchy and the emergence of printing press capitalism ("the
convergence of capitalism and print technology... standardization of national
calendars, clocks and language was embodied in books and the publication of daily
newspapers")—all phenomena occurring with the start of the Industrial
Revolution. From this Anderson argues that in the presence and development of
technology people started to make differences between what means divine and
divinity and what really is history and politics, because initially the divine and the
history of society and politics was based on the existence of a common religion
that was a unification umbrella for all the people across Europe. With the
emergence of the printing press and also capitalism, people gained some sort of
national consciousness regarding the common values that bring those people
together. The Imagined Communities started with the creation of their own nation
print-languages that were spoken by each individual. That helped the development
of the first forms of known nation-states, who then created their own form of art,
novels, publications, mass-media, and communications.
While attempting to define nationalism, Anderson identifies three paradoxes:
"(1) The objective modernity of nations to the historians' eyes vs. their subjective
antiquity in the eyes of nationalists.
(2) The formal universality of nationality as a socio-cultural concept [and]
(3) the 'political' power of such nationalisms vs. their philosophical poverty and
even incoherence."
Anderson talks of Unknown Soldier tombs as an example of nationalism. The
tombs of Unknown Soldiers are either empty or hold unidentified remains, but
each nation with these kinds of memorials claims these soldiers as their own. No
matter what the actual origin of the Unknown Soldier is, these nations have placed
them within their imagined community.

                            9. The Philippines’ COVID-19 Response: Securitising the Pandemic and Disciplining the Pasaway Karl Hapal (2021) Duterte has securitised COVID-19. This was achieved by fulfilling the three main elements of securitisation – the identification of an existential threat, emergency measures, and breaking free of rules. The securitisation of COVID-19 relied on framing the pandemic as war – a fight for the nation‟s survival. This was used to justify the draconian response by the government in an attempt to suppress the spread of the virus. This was primarily achieved by utilising and expanding the powers of the state‟s law enforcement apparatus. While Duterte has successfully securitised COVID-19, he has done so in a peculiar way. Duterte‟s securitising act relied on his populist rhetoric – a populist securitising act so to speak. Seen this way, Duterte‟s populist rhetoric served as the speech act that argued for and legitimised the securitisation of COVID-19. A key element of his populist securitising act was projecting the Philippines under siege by a sinister menace that may undermine the well-being of Filipinos. Duterte‟s populist securitising act invariably produced the pasaway archetype, an erring and bullheaded subject who, through its behaviour, became the embodiment of the virus‟ deadly qualities. Consequently, this was used to justify the intense policing and disciplining campaign against the pasaway. The war against COVID-19 turned into a war against the pasaway. The war against the pasaway is an attempt by the government to protect virtuous citizens from an unwanted and undesirable “other.” The disproportionate focus on the pasaway, however, is not only to mitigate its bullheaded behaviour. It is also informed by deep-seated class prejudices – the pasaway, in some ways, resembling the colonised and racialised other. The bifurcated narrative and the concomitant legitimisation of the use of the state‟s coercive power have long been used to produce, maintain, and reinforce societal divides. Beyond class, however, the underlying discourse that informed the production of the pasaway soon spread to other groups‟ perceived derailing of governmental efforts against the virus. In this sense, the pasaway became an empty signifier representing any other behaviour or actions deemed disagreeable. As an empty signifier, the campaign to address the pasaway extended to not only arresting bullheaded individuals but also to silence dissent. While the pasaway has become an encompassing pejorative term, it still relied on the bifurcated depiction of Filipino society and the need to save the virtuous from the errant. These dualist and oppositional narratives are, however, not new. They resemble what has informed and animated Duterte‟s campaigns against illegal drugs, criminality, corruption, oligarchy, communism, and so on. These narratives serve to present a bifurcated society, an existential threat, and an accompanying justification to pursue actions with force and haste in the name of social justice and national integrity. Take, for example, the war on drugs. Duterte depicted the widespread sale and use of illegal drugs as “a clear national security threat […] an invasion of a new kind […] [and] a war against our families and children” (Philippine Daily Inquirer, 2020). Moreover, Duterte was able to frame the war on drugs as a noble crusade to salvage the Filipino nation (Hapal, 2019). In this crusade, society is seen as composed of good people and of demons (demonyo). The role of the government (particularly law enforcement) is “predictably, like avenging angels, to eliminate the demons to protect society – in other words, to keep the integrity of the „thin blue line‟” (Jensen and Hapal, 2018: 49). In this sense, the war against COVID-19 may be understood in conjunction with Duterte‟s other “wars on […]” Amid the pandemic, the government relentlessly continued its war on drugs, criminality, and corruption; intensified its war against terrorism alongside the passage of the controversial Anti-Terrorism Law; and escalated its campaign to dismantle so-called oligarchs, ABS-CBN – the largest media network in the Philippines – as one of the casualties. These wars are being fought to address a clear and present threat to ensure the well-being and future of the nation. And, more importantly, it presents an enemy to vanquish. The war on COVID-19 had serious consequences. Through the archetype of the pasaway, the government has, wittingly or unwittingly, turned the Filipino people into the enemy. This came to be as the virus, initially conceived as an “unseen enemy” creeping to infect, kill, and upend the lives of Filipinos, took a corporeal form. In other words, COVID-19‟s deadly and devastating qualities were soon embodied with the bullheaded character of the pasaway. It became the enemy order and, consequently, the object of disciplining and punishment. pasagot namn sa nakakaalam maraming salamat​</h2><br />
