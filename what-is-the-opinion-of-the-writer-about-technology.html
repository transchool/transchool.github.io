The Philippine government didn’t impose travel bans and stringent safety protocols fast enough to prevent the virus from entering the country, the slacking and inattentiveness of the government caused some massive consequences to the entire nation.Since the Philippines is only a developing country or a so-called third-world country, the government could not very much contain the effects of the deadly pandemic, imposing lockdowns and keeping people to go out of their houses and huddling together were not enough to prevent more than 8,500 people to perish within 8 months and a worldwide death or 2.1 million people.Note: Please do expound this position paper, I already provided the most important parts, you just have to add more to strengthen your position regarding the issue.Assesment:1.TRUE2.TRUE 3.TRUE4.TRUE5.FALSE6.TRUE7.FALSE8.TRUE9.TRUE10.TRUEII.1.a position paper presents one side of an arguable opinion about an issue.

                                            What Is Education and Why Is It Important? By Ananya Mahapatra Source: https://www.atg.world/view-article/IMPORTANCEOFEDUCATION-70 Education is a learning experience where an individual learns about various aspects of life, understands the different perspectives and tries to apply it in daily life. Education is important to the children, to adults and to the society. Education gives people knowledge of the world around them and changes it into something better. It develops in people a perspective of looking at life, helps them build opinions and have points of view on things in life. Mahatma Gandhi once quoted, "Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever." This portrays the importance of education and leaming in one's life. If a child is joined in a school, he will start leaming, playing and enjoy with friends. While leaming he will understand what position he is in acquiring knowledge and he will leam slowly to grab the top position. While playing he will understand the logic to win it; this way they start building goals at an early stage. But parents should understand whether their children are working only for ranks and grades or acquiring some wisdom or not. It is important that they are aware of the purpose of education and how it works in real life. They start maintaining a structured life. To an individual, education increases the level of confidence as it makes a person aware about his/her surroundings. It also helps an individual to communicate better and express his/her opinions.

The Philippine government didn’t impose travel bans and stringent safety protocols fast enough to prevent the virus from entering the country, the slacking and inattentiveness of the government caused some massive consequences to the entire nation.Since the Philippines is only a developing country or a so-called third-world country, the government could not very much contain the effects of the deadly pandemic, imposing lockdowns and keeping people to go out of their houses and huddling together were not enough to prevent more than 8,500 people to perish within 8 months and a worldwide death or 2.1 million people.Note: Please do expound this position paper, I already provided the most important parts, you just have to add more to strengthen your position regarding the issue.Assesment:1.TRUE2.TRUE 3.TRUE4.TRUE5.FALSE6.TRUE7.FALSE8.TRUE9.TRUE10.TRUEII.1.a position paper presents one side of an arguable opinion about an issue.

While leaming he will understand what position he is in acquiring knowledge and he will leam slowly to grab the top position. While playing he will understand the logic to win it; this way they start building goals at an early stage. But parents should understand whether their children are working only for ranks and grades or acquiring some wisdom or not. It is important that they are aware of the purpose of education and how it works in real life. They start maintaining a structured life. To an individual, education increases the level of confidence as it makes a person aware about his/her surroundings. It also helps an individual to communicate better and express his/her opinions.

For example, <strong>technology has built the strongest communication </strong>bridges between people in the world so that they can communicate with each other wherever they are, and they can travel wherever they want.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Technology is the overall means of providing goods needed for the continuity and comfort of human life. <strong>The use of technology by humans begins with the conversion </strong>of natural resources into simple tools. In its journey, science and technology are indeed a unity that cannot be separated. Science plays a role in creating new technology, and conversely technology plays a role in creating new knowledge. Technology also plays a role in making it easier to carry out activities. Of course, with easy access to technology, the work activities carried out with this technology also feel light and easy to carry out. Again, by utilizing technology allows companies to make efficiency</p><p>The first positive side of technological development is the ease of receiving information, both locally and internationally. Unlike in the past, in this modern era, we don't have to bother buying newspapers. To read the news or get the latest information, just go to Google and ask for the latest news of the day. <strong>Automatically Google will then display some of the latest </strong>information and news. You only need to click on one of the titles and read the writing in it. In this modern era, you only need to send messages or information to other people by simply opening the messaging application.
