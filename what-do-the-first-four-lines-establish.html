Do this in your notebook.If We Must DieBy: Claude McKay (1889–1948)If we must die, let it not be like hogs Hunted and penned in an inglorious spot,  While round us bark the mad and hungry dogs,  Making their mock at our accursèd lot. If we must die, O let us nobly die, So that our precious blood may not be shed In vain; then even the monsters we defy Shall be constrained to honor us though dead! O kinsmen! we must meet the common foe! Though far outnumbered let us show us brave, And for their thousand blows deal one death-blow! What though before us lies the open grave? Like men we’ll face the murderous, cowardly pack, Pressed to the wall, dying, but fighting back!Questions:1. What do the first four lines establish? 2.

If We Must Die By Claude McKay (1889–1948) If we must die, let it not be like hogs Hunted and penned in an inglorious spot, While round us bark the mad and hungry dogs, Making their mock at our accursèd lot. If we must die, Olet us nobly die, So that our precious blood may not be shed In vain; then even the monsters we defy Shall be constrained to honor us though dead! O kinsmen! we must meet the common foe! Though far outnumbered let us show us brave, And for their thousand blows deal one death-blow! What though before us lies the open grave? Like men we'll face the murderous, cowardly pack, Pressed to the wall, dying, but fighting back! LUKAS Questions: CIMD 1. What do the first four lines establish? 2. What message does the persona forward to his allies? 3. How does the persona describe his enemies? 4. According to the poet, how can one die nobly? 5.

                        <p><strong>The poem was written by Claude McKay in a Shakespearean sonnet style made of fourteen lines. </strong>It follows a 1212 3434 5656 77 pattern that uses iambic pentameter. Each line consists of five sets of metrical feet in two beats.</p><p></p><p>Here is the interpretation of the first 4 lines of the poem:</p><p></p><p><strong>The first line of the poem tells the author or the poet that his countrymen must not be like the captured animals.</strong> They are captured and are not given rights. He is calling to action to raise their voice and their rights should not be taken away from them. He is also encouraging everyone to avoid being a coward especially when they know they are on the right side of the story or situation. He wants them to realize that they should be not abused in their land.</p><p></p><p>The poet wants his countrymen to be strong enough to fight back. They should do what is right especially when they think their power is being abused. If they will face the unfortunate, it would be better to face it for the country and not from the slavery they have been experiencing on that day. </p><p></p><p><strong>This is the summary of the poem:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Beginning </strong><br />The poem begins by addressing the poet's countrymen. He is telling or educating them to avoid ending up like in the fate of caged animals. They should not spend their life in hell without any rights at all. </p><p></p><p><strong>Middle </strong></p><p>The poet is seeking approach to educate his fellow to fight back for their rights. They need to have a good life from any type of abuse. </p><p></p><p><strong>End </strong></p><p>The poet encourages to have a protest with all the people who believe in him. They want to create history and show the world that they know how to fight back for they know what is right.</p><p> </p><p></p><p>Interpreting poems are best done in paragraph forms. It helps us to understand the poem more than the metaphors and idiomatic expressions found in every line.

What message does the persona forward to his allies?</p><p></p><p></p><p>========</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>The persona is a black American who is oppressed, humiliated and persecuted. We know this from the history of the poet and the fact that blacks were hunted, penned (locked in small cells) and killed like hogs (pigs) in America. Hunted and penned in an inglorious spot.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>4.According to the poet, how can one die nobly?</p><p></p><p></p><p>===========</p>For the speaker, dying nobly means that his death won't be meaningless or "in vain.""[P]recious blood" sounds a bit like biblical language, and brings to mind images of Jesus Christ being sacrificed.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>5.Using the Venn diagram below, compare in the poem and in the article in</p><p></p><p></p><p>=========</p>circles to show the relationships among things or finite groups of things. Circles that overlap have a commonality while circles that do not overlap do not share those traits.Venn diagrams help to visually represent the similarities and differences between two concepts. They have long been recognized for their usefulness as educational tools. Since the mid-20th century, Venn diagrams have been used as part of the introductory logic curriculum and in elementary-level educational plans around the world.Applications for Venn DiagramsVenn diagrams are used to depict how items relate to each other against an overall backdrop, universe, data set, or environment. A Venn diagram could be used, for example, to compare two companies within the same industry by illustrating the products both companies offer (where circles overlap) and the products that are exclusive to each company (outer circles). Venn diagrams are, at a basic level, simple pictorial representations of the relationship that exists between two sets of things. However, they can be much more complex. Still, the streamlined purpose of the Venn diagram to illustrate concepts and groups has led to their popularized use in many fields, including statistics, linguistics, logic, education, computer science, and business.Examples of Venn DiagramsA Venn diagram could be drawn to illustrate fruits that come in red or orange colors. Below, we can see that there are orange fruits (circle B) such as persimmons and tangerines while apples and cherries (circle A) come in red colors. Peppers and tomatoes come in both red and orange colors, as represented by the overlapping area of the two circles.<p>꧁༒───────────────────༒꧂</p><p></p><p></p><p>[tex]\rm\blue{\overbrace{\underbrace{\tt\color{pink}{ \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: ✨B.FRANCINE✨\: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: }}}}[/tex]</p><p></p><p>#CARRY ON LEARNING</p><p>#BRAINLY</p><p>#BRAINLYPH</p><p></p><br />
