The whole village was tired of him; he was always gloomy, he constantly complained and was always in a bad mood.<br /><br />The longer he lived, the more bile he was becoming and the more poisonous were his words. People avoided him, because his misfortune became contagious. It was even unnatural and insulting to be happy next to him.<br /><br />He created the feeling of unhappiness in others.<br /><br />But one day, when he turned eighty years old, an incredible thing happened. Instantly everyone started hearing the rumour:<br /><br /><br /><br />“An Old Man is happy today, he doesn’t complain about anything, smiles, and even his face is freshened up.”<br /><br /><br /><br />The whole village gathered together. The old man was asked:<br /><br />Villager: What happened to you?<br /><br /><br /><br />“Nothing special. Eighty years I’ve been chasing happiness, and it was useless. And then I decided to live without happiness and just enjoy life. That’s why I’m happy now.” – An Old Man<br /><br /><br /><br />Moral of the story:<br />Don’t chase happiness. Enjoy your life.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>         The Milkmaid and Her Pail</strong></p>One day, Molly the milkmaid had filled her pails with milk. Her job was to milk the cows, and then bring the milk to the market to sell. Molly loved to think about what to spend her money on.<p></p>As she filled the pails with milk and went to market, she again thought of all the things she wanted to buy. As she walked along the road, she thought of buying a cake and a basket full of fresh strawberries.<p></p>A little further down the road, she spotted a chicken. She thought, “With the money I get from today, I’m going to buy a chicken of my own. That chicken will lay eggs, then I will be able to sell milk and eggs and get more money!”<p></p>She continued, “With more money, I will be able to buy a fancy dress and make all the other milkmaids jealous.” Out of excitement, Molly started skipping, forgetting about the milk in her pails. Soon, the milk started spilling over the edges, covering Molly.<p></p>Drenched, Molly said to herself, “Oh no! I will never have enough money to buy a chicken now.” She went home with her empty pails.<p></p>“Oh, my goodness! What happened to you?” Molly’s mother asked.<p></p>“I was too busy dreaming about all the things I wanted to buy that I forgot about the pails,” she answered.<p></p>“Oh, Molly, my dear. How many times do I need to say, ‘Don’t count your chickens until they hatch?’”<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Main Character: Molly</p><p>Time: Day</p><p>Setting: Farm</p><p>Moral Lesson: Don't count your chickens until they hatch</p><p>Climax: Molly counted her pails when they are not hatched</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a farmer named John. John was a hardworking man and he loved his land more than anything else in the world. He would spend hours working on his farm, planting crops and tending to his animals.</p><p></p><p>One day, a great storm came and swept through the village, destroying everything in its path. John's farm was no exception, and all of his crops were ruined.</p><p></p><p>Feeling devastated, John sat on the remains of his farm and cried. But then he heard a small, gentle voice say, "Do not be sad, John. The storm may have destroyed your crops, but it has also brought new life to your land. Look around you and see the opportunities that the storm has brought."</p><p></p><p>John looked around and saw that the storm had cleared away the old, dead plants and had left behind rich, fertile soil. He realized that the storm had given him a chance to start fresh and to plant new, stronger crops.</p><p></p><p>With renewed hope, John began to work on his farm again, and this time, his crops grew stronger and more bountiful than ever before.</p><p></p><p>The moral of the story is that sometimes, when we face great challenges, it can be hard to see the opportunities that they bring. But if we stay strong and keep a positive attitude, we can turn those challenges into opportunities for growth and success.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            15. Write a short story with plot character setting and moral lesson ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>     the answer is in the picture<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The force that works against the hero of the story; if a person, often a villain type. setting. The time and place of the action of the story. plot. The sequence of events in a story, built around a conflict.</p> Plot - How the author arranges events to develop the basic idea; it is the sequence of events in a story or play. The plot is a planned, logical series of events having a beginning, middle, and end. The short story usually has one plot  so it can be read in one sitting. There are five essential parts of plot:
1) Exposition (introduction) - Beginning of the story; characters, background, and setting revealed.
2) Rising Action - Events in the story become complicated; the conflict is revealed. These are events between
<p>         the introduction and climax.
</p><p>• Conflict - Essential to plot, opposition ties incidents together and moves the plot. Not merely
</p><p>limited to arguments, conflict can be any fOfI1)of struggle the main character faces. Within a short
</p><p>story, there may be only one central struggle, or there may be many minor obstacles within a
</p><p>dominant struggle. There are two ~ of conflict:
</p><p>o Internal- Struggle within one's self.
</p><p>• Character vs. Self - Struggles with own soul, physical limitations, choices, etc.
</p><p>o External - Struggle with a force outside one's self.
</p><p>• Character vs. Character - Struggles against other people.
</p><p>• Character vs. Nature - Struggles against animals, weather, environment, etc.
</p><p>• Character vs. Society - Struggles against ideas, practices, or customs of others
</p><p>3) Climax - Turning point of the story. Readers wonders what will happen next; will the conflict be resolved
</p><p>or not? Consider the climax as a three-fold phenomenon:
</p><p>• Main character receives new information.
</p><p>• Main character accepts this information (realizes it but does not necessarily agree with it).
</p><p>• Main character acts on this information (makes a choice that will determine whether or not objective is met).
</p>4) Falling action - Resolution begins; events and complications start to fall into place. These are the events
<p>         between climax and denouement.
</p>5) Resolution (Conclusion) - Final outcome of events in the story.
<p><strong>II. </strong>Setting - Time and location that a story takes place. For some stories, the setting is very important; while for
</p><p>others, it is not. When examining how setting contributes to a story, there are multiple aspects to consider:
</p>1) Place - Geographical location; where is the action of the story taking place?
2) Time - Historical period, time of day, year, etc; when is the story taking place?
3) Weather conditions - Is it rainy, sunny, stormy, etc?
4) Social conditions - What is the daily life of the character's like? Does the story contain local colour (writing
<p>that focuses on the speech, dress, mannerisms, customs, etc. of a particular place)?
</p>5) Mood or atmosphere - What feeling is created at the beginning of the story? Cheerful or eerie?
<p><strong>III.</strong> Character - There are two meanings for "character": 1) a person in a fictional story; or 2) qualities of a person.
</p> 1) People in a work of fiction can be a(n):
<p>• Protagonist - Clear center of story; all major events are important to this character.
</p><p>• Antagonist - Opposition or "enemy" of main character.
</p>2) Characteristics of a character can be revealed through:
<p>• his/her physical appearance
</p><p>• what he/she says, thinks, feels, dreams and what he/she does or does not do
</p><p>• what others say about him/her and how others react to him/her3) Characters can be ...
</p><p>o Round - Fully developed personalities that are affected by the story's events; they can learn, grow,
</p><p>or deteriorate by the end of the story. Characters are most convincing when they resemble real
</p><p>people by being consistent, motivated, and life-like.
</p><p>• Flat - One-dimensional character
</p><p>• Dynamic - Character who does go through change and "grows" during a story
</p><p>• Static - Character does not go through a change.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>• Things are not always as they appear to be.
</p><p>• Love is blind.
</p><p>• Believe in yourself.
</p><p>• People are afraid of change.
</p><p>• Don't judge a book by its cover</p><br />

</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>The longer he lived, the more bile he was becoming and the more poisonous were his words. People avoided him, because his misfortune became contagious. It was even unnatural and insulting to be happy next to him.

He created the feeling of unhappiness in others.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>
But one day, when he turned eighty years old, an incredible thing happened. Instantly everyone started hearing the rumour:</strong></p><p><strong>“An Old Man is happy today, he doesn’t complain about anything, smiles, and even his face is freshened up.”

The whole village gathered together. The old man was asked:

                        Foot prints  the story goes like this: One night, a man had a dream he was walking along a beach with The Lord. Across the sky flashed scenes for his life. For each scene, he noticed two sets of footprints in the sand: one belonged to him the other to The Lord. When the last scene of his life flashed before him he looked at the footprints in the sand. He noticed  there was only one set of footprints, and that happened at the very lowest and saddest times of his life. This really bothered him and he questioned The Lord about it. "Lord, you said that once I decided to follow You, You'd walk all the way. But during the most troublesome times in my life I only saw one set of footprints. I don't understand why when I needed You most You would leave me." The Lord replied, "My Son, My precious Child, I love you and would never leave you. During your times of trial and suffering, when you see only one set of footprints, it was then that I CARRIED YOU!"<br />

                        <strong>Give me a short story with moral lesson?</strong><strong></strong><strong>the boy who cried wolf</strong><strong>Once, there was a boy who became bored when he watched over the village sheep grazing on the hillside. To entertain himself, he sang out, “Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!”
</strong><strong>
</strong><strong>When the villagers heard the cry, they came running up the hill to drive the wolf away. But, when they arrived, they saw no wolf. The boy was amused when seeing their angry faces.
</strong><strong>
</strong><strong>“Don’t scream wolf, boy,” warned the villagers, “when there is no wolf!” They angrily went back down the hill.
</strong><strong>
</strong><strong>Later, the shepherd boy cried out once again, “Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!” To his amusement, he looked on as the villagers came running up the hill to scare the wolf away.
</strong><strong>
</strong><strong>As they saw there was no wolf, they said strictly, “Save your frightened cry for when there really is a wolf! Don’t cry ‘wolf’ when there is no wolf!” But the boy grinned at their words while they walked grumbling down the hill once more.
</strong><strong>
</strong><strong>Later, the boy saw a real wolf sneaking around his flock. Alarmed, he jumped on his feet and cried out as loud as he could, “Wolf! Wolf!” But the villagers thought he was fooling them again, and so they didn’t come to help.
</strong><strong>
</strong><strong>At sunset, the villagers went looking for the boy who hadn’t returned with their sheep. When they went up the hill, they found him weeping.
</strong><strong>
</strong><strong>
</strong><strong>“There really was a wolf here! The flock is gone! I cried out, ‘Wolf!’ but you didn’t come,” he wailed.
</strong><strong>
</strong><strong>An old man went to comfort the boy. As he put his arm around him, he said, “Nobody believes a liar, even when he is telling the truth!”
