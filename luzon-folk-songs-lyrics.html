                                            What is Itq &amp;particularFolk songs in general have the following characteristicsA. The lyrics are according to the native tongue.Because songs are based on the daily experiences of the peoplein aplace and the message of the songs needs to be understood easily to be appreciated,the lyrics of the songs are written or sung in their own dialects. For example, theTagalog folk songs came from the people who speak Tagalog (Bahay Kubo, Leron,Leron Sinta, Magtanim ay Di Biro). The Ilocanos have their own (Manang Biday andSarung Banggi are just a few among the folk songs of Luzon that are sung in theirPamulinawen). The Kapampangan's Atin Cu Pung Singsing, and the Bicolano'sown dialects. Why do you think it is important for a folk song to be sung or writtenin their native tongue?B. Passed down through oral tradition to family or community members, hence,learned by mere memorizationSinging is a form of social bonding among early Filipino families. Because theydid not have access to internet, T.V. and radio during that time, singing folksongsbecame their favorite pastime.C. Unknown composers and lyricistsMost composers of Filipino folk songs are unknown because songs are justbased on daily experiences and are passed down orally.D. Simple key signature of the songDo you know how to play a guitar? If you can play this instrument, you cantry to play a simple folk song. While playing, you will notice that it starts with aparticular key (key of G for example) and ends in that same key. That only shows thesimplicity of the Luzon folk songs.E. Duple, triple, or, quadruple are common meters usedThese meters were very common during that time. The dances and commonsongs are based on these meters. The composers of the folk songs adopted theserhythmic patterns to their compositions.What folk songs do you know? Can you identify the meters used based on thediscussion in the review section of this module?F. Primarily based on the community's culture, tradition and livelihood​</a>

                                            A. The lyrics are according to the native tongue.Because songs are based on the daily experiences of the people in a particularplace and the message of the songs needs to be understood easily to be appreciated.the lyrics of the songs are written or sung in their own dialects. For example, theTagalog folk songs came from the people who speak Tagalog. (Bahay Kubo, Leron,Leron Sinta, Magtanim ay Di Biro). The Ilocanos have their own (Manang Biday andPamulinawen). The Kapampangan's Atin Cu Pung Singsing, and the Bicolano'sSarung Banggi are just a few among the folk songs of Luzon that are sung in theirown dialects.

                            4. What is Itq &amp;particularFolk songs in general have the following characteristicsA. The lyrics are according to the native tongue.Because songs are based on the daily experiences of the peoplein aplace and the message of the songs needs to be understood easily to be appreciated,the lyrics of the songs are written or sung in their own dialects. For example, theTagalog folk songs came from the people who speak Tagalog (Bahay Kubo, Leron,Leron Sinta, Magtanim ay Di Biro). The Ilocanos have their own (Manang Biday andSarung Banggi are just a few among the folk songs of Luzon that are sung in theirPamulinawen). The Kapampangan's Atin Cu Pung Singsing, and the Bicolano'sown dialects. Why do you think it is important for a folk song to be sung or writtenin their native tongue?B. Passed down through oral tradition to family or community members, hence,learned by mere memorizationSinging is a form of social bonding among early Filipino families. Because theydid not have access to internet, T.V. and radio during that time, singing folksongsbecame their favorite pastime.C. Unknown composers and lyricistsMost composers of Filipino folk songs are unknown because songs are justbased on daily experiences and are passed down orally.D. Simple key signature of the songDo you know how to play a guitar? If you can play this instrument, you cantry to play a simple folk song. While playing, you will notice that it starts with aparticular key (key of G for example) and ends in that same key. That only shows thesimplicity of the Luzon folk songs.E. Duple, triple, or, quadruple are common meters usedThese meters were very common during that time. The dances and commonsongs are based on these meters. The composers of the folk songs adopted theserhythmic patterns to their compositions.What folk songs do you know? Can you identify the meters used based on thediscussion in the review section of this module?F. Primarily based on the community's culture, tradition and livelihood​</h2><br />
