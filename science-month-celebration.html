His older brothers and sistershave agreed that each of them will save up to give their parents a unique and special gift. His two eldestsiblings already have jobs so saving up is no problem. As for him and his other two siblings who are still inschool, their parents normally give them an allowance that is more than enough so that if they have minorexpenses to settle in school, they will not anymore ask for money from their parents. However, Angelo has nobeen able to foresee the expenses he would incur in accomplishing his Science project. He has thoughtasking help from his siblings but realized that it would be difficult for them to lend him money for their savingare obviously reserved for their surprise to their parents. What should Angelo do?​</a>

To do so,(COMPUTER) you will need to survey the commonly used brands of three food types (Ex. Milk, biscuit andfruit juice in tetrapack) and analyze the nutritional value of each product based on the nutrition factsindicated in the product labels. (SCIENCE) An analysis of the relative amounts of nutrients in each product,expressed as percent composition, should be shown to compare their major nutrients. (CLJThe group willhold an information dissemination session with the members of the community. Especially products thatbetter serve the nutritional needs of a large number of consumers. In addition, you need to encourage theaudience to practice health consciousness in choosing food products through a song (MUSIC). To furtherenhance their knowledge on food nutrition, teach the audience how to read and analyze the nutritioninformation in food labels.​</a>
