                            1. The Role of Filipino Culture to Filipino Self and Identity</h2><br />
                        <p>The culture speaks about the very personality of each nation and every individual. It shows the everyday living and the habit either the positive and negative ways. The cultural dances and songs provide us the rituals of marriage and devotion. The love to our nature and country had been painted to our dresses and drawings of the past.</p><p>You are in your position right now because of the stored history, and that is what the culture means.</p><br />

                            2. the role of filipino consumer culture to filipino self and identity</h2><br />
                        <p><strong></strong></p><p>Consumer behavior has affected Filipinos' self identity.  Consumer behavior refers the study on how people mentally, physically  or emotionally react or respond on different products and services.  Self-identity refers to the overall perception of oneself in relation  to the society someone belongs to.
</p><p>
</p><p>The  Filipino people's buying behavior has become highly dependent on  vanity and materialism nowadays. This means that more people  would more likely buy products as long as these have higher aesthetic  value and "better" than what others are using. An example of this phenomenon is  investing more on top-rated yet very expensive gadgets as opposed  choosing more functional ones. People buy products based on the physical  aspects and not by the content. Another example of this is parents opting to buy formula  milk brand A because it is simply much more expensive than brand B when in fact the nutritional  value of both is just the same. These characteristics of Filipino consumers lead to higher  spending on disposable income and not being able to save money anymore. Expensive products like  cars and gadgets also need higher maintenance which means consumers end up spending even more  than what they originally planned.
</p><p>
</p><p>In my own opinion, Filipino consumers' buying habits have to be remodeled. I am also guilty of this unhealthy behavior and I think people's perception on products have to change.

                            18. what is the role of filipino consumer culture to filipino self and identity </h2><br />
                        <p><strong>The consumer’s role in society is to keep the trade alive and well.</strong> When people buy and sell goods, people get what they want and need while boosting the economy of the country. This behavior can play an important role in promoting our identity as a people by consuming locally made products instead of purchasing imported ones. This will strengthen our economy by helping out Filipino owned businesses which will then hire more employees and put more people to work. It isn’t wrong to buy imported products, we all know that many of them are better than ours, that is something we have to accept, but when it comes to certain items which we know are about the same quality as that of the imports, <strong>we could probably patronize ours and save a bit of money while doing it.

                            19. research about the role of filipino consumer culture in filipino self and identity</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Consumer behavior</strong> has affected <strong>Filipinos' self identity</strong>.  <strong>Consumer behavior</strong> refers the study on how people mentally, physically  or emotionally react or respond on different products and services.  <strong>Self-identity</strong> refers to the overall perception of oneself in relation  to the society someone belongs to. </p><p>The  Filipino people's <strong>buying behavior</strong> has become highly dependent on  vanity and materialism nowadays. This means that more people  would more likely buy products as long as these have higher aesthetic  value and "better" than what others are using. An example of this phenomenon is  investing more on top-rated yet very expensive gadgets as opposed  choosing more functional ones. People buy products based on the physical  aspects and not by the content. Another example of this is parents opting to buy formula  milk brand A because it is simply much more expensive than brand B when in fact the nutritional  value of both is just the same. These <strong>characteristics of Filipino consumers</strong> lead to higher  spending on disposable income and not being able to save money anymore. Expensive products like  cars and gadgets also need higher maintenance which means consumers end up spending even more  than what they originally planned. </p><p>In my own opinion, Filipino consumers' <strong>buying habits </strong>have to be remodeled. I am also guilty of this unhealthy behavior and I think people's perception on products have to change.</p><br /><p>For more information regarding the topic, kindly go to the following links:</p><p>1. <strong>https://brainly.ph/question/1471776</strong></p><p>2. <strong>https://brainly.ph/question/1850815</strong></p><p>3. <strong>https://brainly.ph/question/286316</strong></p><br />

Her eponymous debut studio album (2006) included the Hot Country Songs number-one singles "Our Song" and "Should've Said No" and the pop radio crossover "Teardrops on My Guitar". Swift rose to mainstream prominence with her country pop second studio album, Fearless (2008), which was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and featured the top-five singles "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me". Her third studio album, Speak Now (2010), blended country pop with rock elements and furthered her crossover success with the top-ten singles "Mine" and "Back to December".</p><p></p><p>Swift's fourth studio album, Red (2012), experimented beyond country, incorporating pop, rock, and electronic genres. She completely transitioned to pop with her synth-pop fifth studio album, 1989 (2014); its successor, Reputation (2017), expanded on the electropop sound with urban influences. Swift released her next studio album, Lover, in 2019, while she was in a dispute over the ownership of her back catalog after her Big Machine contract expired. She explored indie folk and alternative rock on her 2020 studio albums, Folklore and Evermore. These six albums spawned a string of international top-ten singles, including "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together", "I Knew You Were Trouble", "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", "Bad Blood", "Look What You Made Me Do", "Me!", "You Need to Calm Down", "Cardigan", and "Willow". She also released the acclaimed documentaries Miss Americana and Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions in 2020.</p><p></p><p>With sales of over 200 million records worldwide, Swift is one of the best-selling music artists of all time. Her accolades include 11 Grammy Awards (including three Album of the Year wins), a Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Award, two Brit Awards, 11 MTV Video Music Awards (including two Video of the Year wins), 12 Country Music Association Awards, 25 Billboard Music Awards (the most wins by a woman), 32 American Music Awards (the most wins by an artist) and 49 Guinness World Records. She ranked eighth on Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists Chart (2019) and was listed on Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time (2015). Swift has been included in various power rankings, such as Time's annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world (2010, 2015 and 2019) and Forbes Celebrity 100 (placing first in 2016 and 2019). She was named Woman of the Decade (2010s) by Billboard and Artist of the Decade (2010s) by the American Music Awards, and has been recognized for her philanthropic efforts and advocacy of women's and artists' rights.[3]</p><br />
