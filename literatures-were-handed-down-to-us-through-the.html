                                            vainly to warn Snow White, knowing what will happen when she bites into the apple. This shows dramatic irony. G. Theme. Theme is the meaning or concept left to the readers after reading a piece of fiction. A theme usually depicts and unifies the central topic of the story. It gives the reader a deeper significance of the work to people's day to day lives. Moral/lesson of the story is not the theme of the story. Theme is the author's way of sharing ideas, perceptions, and feelings with readers, and it may be directly stated or it may only be implied. The theme unifies the concept of the story. It must adhere to the following requirements: 1. The theme must account all the major details of the story. 2. The theme must not be contradicted by any detail of the story. 3. It must not only rely on supposed facts- facts not actually stated or clearly implied by the story. Furthermore, let us take time and consider some suggestions in creating a theme of a work of literature by Laurence and Thomas Arp, 1993. 1. Theme should be expressed in a statement form having a subject and predicate. 2. Theme must be stated as a generalization about life. 3. Do not make the generalization larger (or smaller) than is justified by the terms of the story. 4. Theme unifies the concept of a story. Therefore, a theme accounts all the major details of the story, it is not contradicted by any detail of a story and it does not rely upon supposed facts. 5. There is no single way of stating a theme. 6. Avoid using statement that reduces the theme to some familiar saying, proverb, or axiom. HOME BASED ACTIVITIES TASK 1: CHARACTER SKETCH BE LIKE!

                                            Think again about the story "Captured by Opechancanough."Note that the narrator tells about his travels. A travel account iscalled a journal. The journal of Captain John Smith-a recordof the perils and frustrations of America's first settlers-is oneof the first literature of America."Capture by Opechancanough"              An excerpt           By John SmithWith two Indians for my quides and two of our own company, I set out, leaving seven in the barge. Having explored twenty miles further in this desert, I found that the river still kept its depth and breadth, but that it was much more thickly lined with trees.Some twelve miles above the barge, we went ashore to refresh ourselves and to cook our food. One of the Indians 1 took with me to examine the nature of the soil and to cross the bends of the river. The other Indian I left with John Robinson and Thomas Emry, with their matches, light, and with the order that they should discharge a gun for my retreat, at the first sight of any Indian.Within a quarter of an hour, I heard a loud cry and the yelling of Indians, but no warning shot. Supposing my companions were surprised, and that the Indian guides had betrayed us, I seized my guide and found his arm fast to my hand with a garter, with my pistol aimed, ready to take revenge upon him. He advised me to fly and seemed ignorant of what was happening.But as he went on, I was struck with an arrow on the right thigh, without however, being seriously harmed. When this happened, I caught sight of two Indians drawing their bows. I prevented them from shooting by firing my French pistol.By the time I had loaded again, three or four more Indians were making ready to shoot. The first had fallen down or fled. At my next discharge, they shot their arrows. I made barricade of my servant, who offered not to fight Twenty or thirty arrows were shot to me, but fell short. I had discharged my pistol three or four times before. Opechanconough, the king of Pamaunck, with two hundred men, surrounded me. Each drew his bow and then lay it on the ground without shooting,My servant explained that I was the captain. They demanded my arms. The rest they said were slain; only me they would spare. My guide implored me not to shoot. In mak ing for the boat, being in the midst of a low quagmire, and minding the Indians more than my steps, 1 stepped directly into the quagmire,as did my Indian also, in trying to draw me out.Thus surprised. I resolved to try their mercy. I cast my arms from me. Until I did this, none dared to approach me; but now they seized me, drew me out of the quagmire, and led me to the king. I presented him with a compass, describing its use as well as I could, and he was so much amazed that he let me go on with a discourse on the roundness of the Earth, and the course of the sun, moon, stars, and planets.He then paid me back with kind speeches and with bread, and led me to where the cone was, and where John Robinson lay, killed. Emry I did not see.From the great number of fires: all through the woods, I realized that the Indians had been hunting deer. At each place where they stopped, I expected them to execute me as kindly as they could.When we approached their town, which was within six miles of the spot where I was captured, all the women and children who had learned of this event came to meet us. The king was well-guarded by twenty bowmen, five on the Blank and five in the rear, and in each flank in front of him a sword and a gun with the same behind him; then a bowman on either side of me. The rest filed along in the rear, forming a V-shape, each with his bow and a handful of arrows, a quiver, grimly painted, at his back. On each flank was a sergeant, one running constantly toward the front, the other toward the rear, at a regular pace in good order. After this performance had lasted for sometime the warriors rushed into a circle with a dance: and finally each man departed for his lodging. The captain conducted me to his lodging, and gave me for supper a quarter of venison and some ten pounds of bread. What I left was kept for me, and sent with me to my lodging.​</a>

                                            The Story of Creation (Bilaan)
In the very beginning there lived a being so large that he could not be compared with
any known thing. His name was Melu, and when he sat on the clouds, which were his
home, he occupied all the space above. His teeth were pure gold, and because he was
very clean and continually rubbed himself with his hands, his skin became pure white.
The dead skin which he rubbed off his body was placed on one side in a pile, and by and
by this pile became so large that he was annoyed and set himself to consider what he
could do with it.
Finally Melu decided to make the earth; so he worked very hard in putting the dead skin
into shape, and when it was finished he was so pleased with it that he determined to
make two beings like himself, though smaller, to live on it.
Using the remnants of the material left after making the earth, he fashioned two
humans, but just as they were all finished except their noses, Tau Tana from below the
earth appeared and wanted to help him.
Melu did not wish for any assistance, and a great argument ensued. Tau Tana finally
won his point and made the noses which he placed on the people upside down. When
all was finished, Melu and Tau Tana whipped the forms until they moved. Then Melu
went to his home above the clouds, and Tau Tana returned to his place below the earth.
All went well until one day a great rain came, and the people on the earth nearly
drowned from the water which ran off their heads into their noses. Melu, from his place
on the clouds, saw the danger, and he came quickly to earth and saved their lives by
turning their noses the other side up.
The people were very grateful to him, and promised to do anything he should ask of
them. Before he left for the sky, they told him that they were very unhappy living on the
great earth all alone, so he told them to save all the hair from their heads and the dry
skin from their bodies and the next time he came he would make them some
companions. And in this way there came to be a great many people on the earth.

                            11. vainly to warn Snow White, knowing what will happen when she bites into the apple. This shows dramatic irony. G. Theme. Theme is the meaning or concept left to the readers after reading a piece of fiction. A theme usually depicts and unifies the central topic of the story. It gives the reader a deeper significance of the work to people's day to day lives. Moral/lesson of the story is not the theme of the story. Theme is the author's way of sharing ideas, perceptions, and feelings with readers, and it may be directly stated or it may only be implied. The theme unifies the concept of the story. It must adhere to the following requirements: 1. The theme must account all the major details of the story. 2. The theme must not be contradicted by any detail of the story. 3. It must not only rely on supposed facts- facts not actually stated or clearly implied by the story. Furthermore, let us take time and consider some suggestions in creating a theme of a work of literature by Laurence and Thomas Arp, 1993. 1. Theme should be expressed in a statement form having a subject and predicate. 2. Theme must be stated as a generalization about life. 3. Do not make the generalization larger (or smaller) than is justified by the terms of the story. 4. Theme unifies the concept of a story. Therefore, a theme accounts all the major details of the story, it is not contradicted by any detail of a story and it does not rely upon supposed facts. 5. There is no single way of stating a theme. 6. Avoid using statement that reduces the theme to some familiar saying, proverb, or axiom. HOME BASED ACTIVITIES TASK 1: CHARACTER SKETCH BE LIKE!

                            13. Think again about the story "Captured by Opechancanough."Note that the narrator tells about his travels. A travel account iscalled a journal. The journal of Captain John Smith-a recordof the perils and frustrations of America's first settlers-is oneof the first literature of America."Capture by Opechancanough"              An excerpt           By John SmithWith two Indians for my quides and two of our own company, I set out, leaving seven in the barge. Having explored twenty miles further in this desert, I found that the river still kept its depth and breadth, but that it was much more thickly lined with trees.Some twelve miles above the barge, we went ashore to refresh ourselves and to cook our food. One of the Indians 1 took with me to examine the nature of the soil and to cross the bends of the river. The other Indian I left with John Robinson and Thomas Emry, with their matches, light, and with the order that they should discharge a gun for my retreat, at the first sight of any Indian.Within a quarter of an hour, I heard a loud cry and the yelling of Indians, but no warning shot. Supposing my companions were surprised, and that the Indian guides had betrayed us, I seized my guide and found his arm fast to my hand with a garter, with my pistol aimed, ready to take revenge upon him. He advised me to fly and seemed ignorant of what was happening.But as he went on, I was struck with an arrow on the right thigh, without however, being seriously harmed. When this happened, I caught sight of two Indians drawing their bows. I prevented them from shooting by firing my French pistol.By the time I had loaded again, three or four more Indians were making ready to shoot. The first had fallen down or fled. At my next discharge, they shot their arrows. I made barricade of my servant, who offered not to fight Twenty or thirty arrows were shot to me, but fell short. I had discharged my pistol three or four times before. Opechanconough, the king of Pamaunck, with two hundred men, surrounded me. Each drew his bow and then lay it on the ground without shooting,My servant explained that I was the captain. They demanded my arms. The rest they said were slain; only me they would spare. My guide implored me not to shoot. In mak ing for the boat, being in the midst of a low quagmire, and minding the Indians more than my steps, 1 stepped directly into the quagmire,as did my Indian also, in trying to draw me out.Thus surprised. I resolved to try their mercy. I cast my arms from me. Until I did this, none dared to approach me; but now they seized me, drew me out of the quagmire, and led me to the king. I presented him with a compass, describing its use as well as I could, and he was so much amazed that he let me go on with a discourse on the roundness of the Earth, and the course of the sun, moon, stars, and planets.He then paid me back with kind speeches and with bread, and led me to where the cone was, and where John Robinson lay, killed. Emry I did not see.From the great number of fires: all through the woods, I realized that the Indians had been hunting deer. At each place where they stopped, I expected them to execute me as kindly as they could.When we approached their town, which was within six miles of the spot where I was captured, all the women and children who had learned of this event came to meet us. The king was well-guarded by twenty bowmen, five on the Blank and five in the rear, and in each flank in front of him a sword and a gun with the same behind him; then a bowman on either side of me. The rest filed along in the rear, forming a V-shape, each with his bow and a handful of arrows, a quiver, grimly painted, at his back. On each flank was a sergeant, one running constantly toward the front, the other toward the rear, at a regular pace in good order. After this performance had lasted for sometime the warriors rushed into a circle with a dance: and finally each man departed for his lodging. The captain conducted me to his lodging, and gave me for supper a quarter of venison and some ten pounds of bread. What I left was kept for me, and sent with me to my lodging.​</h2><br />

                            17. The Story of Creation (Bilaan)
In the very beginning there lived a being so large that he could not be compared with
any known thing. His name was Melu, and when he sat on the clouds, which were his
home, he occupied all the space above. His teeth were pure gold, and because he was
very clean and continually rubbed himself with his hands, his skin became pure white.
The dead skin which he rubbed off his body was placed on one side in a pile, and by and
by this pile became so large that he was annoyed and set himself to consider what he
could do with it.
Finally Melu decided to make the earth; so he worked very hard in putting the dead skin
into shape, and when it was finished he was so pleased with it that he determined to
make two beings like himself, though smaller, to live on it.
Using the remnants of the material left after making the earth, he fashioned two
humans, but just as they were all finished except their noses, Tau Tana from below the
earth appeared and wanted to help him.
Melu did not wish for any assistance, and a great argument ensued. Tau Tana finally
won his point and made the noses which he placed on the people upside down. When
all was finished, Melu and Tau Tana whipped the forms until they moved. Then Melu
went to his home above the clouds, and Tau Tana returned to his place below the earth.
All went well until one day a great rain came, and the people on the earth nearly
drowned from the water which ran off their heads into their noses. Melu, from his place
on the clouds, saw the danger, and he came quickly to earth and saved their lives by
turning their noses the other side up.
The people were very grateful to him, and promised to do anything he should ask of
them. Before he left for the sky, they told him that they were very unhappy living on the
great earth all alone, so he told them to save all the hair from their heads and the dry
skin from their bodies and the next time he came he would make them some
companions. And in this way there came to be a great many people on the earth.
Guide Questions:
1. Answer the following questions about the text. Cite textual evidence to support your
answers.
a. Which aspects of precolonial literature can be found in the story?
b. Oral tradition relied on repeating the stories so they would not be forgotten.
However, as with most things passed through word of mouth, details can
differ. If you were a storyteller from the precolonial times, which parts of the
story do you think would be most important to remember when relaying it to
someone else?
2. Recall any other Filipino creation stories you might have heard and compare it to
the one you just read. Answer the following questions:
a. Why do you think every tribe/region had their own version of a creation
story?
b. Why wasn’t there one standard story for the whole country?
c. Compare the story with a creation story from another region. Can you see
any similarities? What do you think is the reason for these similarities?
