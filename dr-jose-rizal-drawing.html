</strong></p><p><strong>05. Dr. Jose Rizal​ </strong></p><p><strong>Answer: noun</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>A noun is a word that functions as the name of a specific object or set of objects, such as living creatures, places, actions, qualities, states of existence, or ideas. However, noun is not a semantic category, so it cannot be characterized in terms of its meaning.</p><p></p><p><strong>Proper nouns vs. common nouns</strong>
</p><p>One important distinction to be made is whether a noun is a proper noun or a common noun. A proper noun is a specific name of a person, place, or thing, and is always capitalized.
</p><p>
</p><p>Does Tina have much homework to do this evening?
</p><p>Tina is the name of a specific person.
</p><p>
</p><p>I would like to visit Old Faithful.
</p><p>Old Faithful is the specific name of a geological phenomenon.
</p><p>
</p><p>The opposite of a proper noun is a common noun, sometimes known as a generic noun. A common noun is the generic name of an item in a class or group and is not capitalized unless appearing at the beginning of a sentence or in a title.
</p><p>
</p><p>The girl crossed the river.
</p><p>Girl is a common noun; we do not learn the identity of the girl by reading this sentence, though we know the action she takes. River is also a common noun in this sentence.</p><p></p><p>#BRAINLYFAST!</p><br />
