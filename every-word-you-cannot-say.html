                                            What's In Read the poem below about tenses. Understand the poem as there are questions to be answered afterwards. Tense up with English Tenses Almost every day I learn my English And it is not as easy as it seems My brain really cannot finish And now verbs are coming up in my dreams. I was learning the past progressive But that didn't last And I always turned aggressive For, up jumped the simple past. I had expected to be a little faster The past perfect I had wanted to get I would have been a real master If the conditional had not made me upset. The present perfect I hadn't respected Though you can believe me how I've tried The progressive I have been attempting To the rules I have myself tied. They say the future won't either be easy Of that sentence I'm quite certain But I'm going to make an effort, really I don't want it to be another burden. But the thing that keeps me going As I'm fighting with each tense Is that maybe in the future It will perhaps make some kind of sense. (Seni77 2014) What is the poem about?

                                            Learning Task 7. Below is Donald Trump's speech on January 13, 2021 condemning violence onthe US Capitol. Read it intently and critically. Note all the blases and prejudices contained in thepiingbericsideMy follow Americans, I want to speak to you tonight about the troubling events of thepast week. As I have said, the incursion of the US Capitol struck at the very heart of ourRepublic. It ongered and appalled millions of Americans across the political spectrum. I want tobe very clear, I unequivocally condemn the violence that we saw last week. Violence andvandalism have absolutely no place in our country and no place in our movement,Making America Great Again has always been about defending the rule of law,supporting the men and women of law enforcement, and upholding our nation's most sacredtraditions and valuos, Mob violenco goes against everything I believe in and everything ourmovement stands for, No true supporter of mine could over endorse political violence. No truesupporter of mine could ever disrespect law enforcement or our great American flag. No truesupporter of mine could ever threaten or harass their follow Americans. If you do any of thesethings, you are not supporting our movement, you are attacking it and you are attacking ourcountry. We cannot tolerato it.Tragically, over the course of the past year made so difficult because of COVID-19, wehave seen political violence spiral out of control. We have seen too many riots, too many mobs,too many acts of intimidation and destruction. It must stop. Whether you are on the right or onthe left, a Democrat or a Republican, there is never a justification for violence, no excuses, noexceptions, America is a nation of laws. Those who engaged in the attacks last week will bebrought to justiceNow I am asking everyone who has ever believed in our agenda to be thinking of waysto ease tensions, calm tempers, and help to promote peace in our country. There has beenreporting that additional demonstrations are being planned in the coming days, both here inWashington and across the country. I have been briefed by the US Secret Service on thepotential threats, Every American deserves to have their voice heard in a respectful andpeaceful way. That is your First Amendment Right. But I cannot emphasize that there must beno violence, no law breaking and no vandalism of any kind,Everyone must follow our laws and obey the instructions of law enforcement. I havedirected federal agencies to use all necessary resources to maintain order. In Washington,D.C., We are bringing in thousands of National Guard members to secure the city and ensurethat a transition can occur safely and without incident. Like all of you, I was shocked anddeeply saddened by the calamity at the Capitol last week. I want to thank the hundreds ofmillions of incredible American citizens who have responded to this moment with calm,moderation and grace, We will get through this challenge just like we always do.I also want to say a few words about the unprecedented assault on free speech wehave seen in recent days. These are tense and difficult times. The efforts to censor, cancel andblacklist our fellow citizens are wrong and they are dangerous. What is needed now is for us tolisten to one another, not to silence one another. All of us can choose by our actions to riseabove the ranker and find common ground and shared purpose. We must focus on advancingthe interests of the whole nation, delivering the miracle vaccines, defeating the pandemic,rebuilding the economy, protecting our national security and upholding the rule of law.Today, I am calling on all Americans to overcome the passions of the moment and jointogether as one American people. Let us choose to move forward united for the good of ourfarnílies, our communities, and our country. Thank you. God bless you and God bless America,dt​</a>

Even students are studying hard so that they can get a well paid job and eam lots of money in future. (5) Although I think money cannot, it buys happiness. It is something that we cannot live without It is clear that money cannot buy happiness as many people who work hard every day for money are often very unhappy (6) Most of them do not even have time to spend their hard- earned money due to heavy workload or long working hours. They have no time or energy for leisure activities and needless to say, their family and friends (7) hardly get to see them too.

Tense up with English Tenses Almost every day I learn my English And it is not as easy as it seems My brain really cannot finish And now verbs are coming up in my dreams. I was learning the past progressive But that didn't last And I always turned aggressive For, up jumped the simple past. I had expected to be a little faster The past perfect I had wanted to get I would have been a real master If the conditional had not made me upset. The present perfect I hadn't respected Though you can believe me how I've tried The progressive I have been attempting To the rules I have myself tied. They say the future won't either be easy Of that sentence I'm quite certain But I'm going to make an effort, really I don't want it to be another burden. But the thing that keeps me going As I'm fighting with each tense Is that maybe in the future It will perhaps make some kind of sense. (Seni77 2014) What is the poem about? What tenses of the verb were mentioned in the poem? Which of the underlined verbs express present action? What words express action done in the past? Which word expresses future action?

Won't be silenced Though you wanna see me tremble when you try it All I know is I won't go speechless Speechless 'Cause I'll breathe When they try to suffocate me Don't you underestimate me 'Cause I know that I won't go speechless All I know is I won't go speechless Speechless ​</h2><br />

                            12. Learning Task 7. Below is Donald Trump's speech on January 13, 2021 condemning violence onthe US Capitol. Read it intently and critically. Note all the blases and prejudices contained in thepiingbericsideMy follow Americans, I want to speak to you tonight about the troubling events of thepast week. As I have said, the incursion of the US Capitol struck at the very heart of ourRepublic. It ongered and appalled millions of Americans across the political spectrum. I want tobe very clear, I unequivocally condemn the violence that we saw last week. Violence andvandalism have absolutely no place in our country and no place in our movement,Making America Great Again has always been about defending the rule of law,supporting the men and women of law enforcement, and upholding our nation's most sacredtraditions and valuos, Mob violenco goes against everything I believe in and everything ourmovement stands for, No true supporter of mine could over endorse political violence. No truesupporter of mine could ever disrespect law enforcement or our great American flag. No truesupporter of mine could ever threaten or harass their follow Americans. If you do any of thesethings, you are not supporting our movement, you are attacking it and you are attacking ourcountry. We cannot tolerato it.Tragically, over the course of the past year made so difficult because of COVID-19, wehave seen political violence spiral out of control. We have seen too many riots, too many mobs,too many acts of intimidation and destruction. It must stop. Whether you are on the right or onthe left, a Democrat or a Republican, there is never a justification for violence, no excuses, noexceptions, America is a nation of laws. Those who engaged in the attacks last week will bebrought to justiceNow I am asking everyone who has ever believed in our agenda to be thinking of waysto ease tensions, calm tempers, and help to promote peace in our country. There has beenreporting that additional demonstrations are being planned in the coming days, both here inWashington and across the country. I have been briefed by the US Secret Service on thepotential threats, Every American deserves to have their voice heard in a respectful andpeaceful way. That is your First Amendment Right. But I cannot emphasize that there must beno violence, no law breaking and no vandalism of any kind,Everyone must follow our laws and obey the instructions of law enforcement. I havedirected federal agencies to use all necessary resources to maintain order. In Washington,D.C., We are bringing in thousands of National Guard members to secure the city and ensurethat a transition can occur safely and without incident. Like all of you, I was shocked anddeeply saddened by the calamity at the Capitol last week. I want to thank the hundreds ofmillions of incredible American citizens who have responded to this moment with calm,moderation and grace, We will get through this challenge just like we always do.I also want to say a few words about the unprecedented assault on free speech wehave seen in recent days. These are tense and difficult times. The efforts to censor, cancel andblacklist our fellow citizens are wrong and they are dangerous. What is needed now is for us tolisten to one another, not to silence one another. All of us can choose by our actions to riseabove the ranker and find common ground and shared purpose. We must focus on advancingthe interests of the whole nation, delivering the miracle vaccines, defeating the pandemic,rebuilding the economy, protecting our national security and upholding the rule of law.Today, I am calling on all Americans to overcome the passions of the moment and jointogether as one American people. Let us choose to move forward united for the good of ourfarnílies, our communities, and our country. Thank you. God bless you and God bless America,dt​</h2><br />

Choose from the words inside the box Emotive words conjunctions Passive voice Modal verbs Rhetorical Questions Declarative statements Evaluative language (1) Can you imagine living without money in this day and age? (2) Is it even possible to survive without money in today's materialistic and cash driven world? It has been said that money makes the world go round (3) Hence, it is no wonder that money has become the central focus of many people's lives (4) Everyone seems to be working tirelessly for money. Even students are studying hard so that they can get a well paid job and eam lots of money in future. (5) Although I think money cannot, it buys happiness. It is something that we cannot live without It is clear that money cannot buy happiness as many people who work hard every day for money are often very unhappy (6) Most of them do not even have time to spend their hard- earned money due to heavy workload or long working hours. They have no time or energy for leisure activities and needless to say, their family and friends (7) hardly get to see them too. This (8) can make them feel lonely and depressed (9) Thus, working hard for money does not bring happiness instead (10) misery in this case.​</h2><br />
