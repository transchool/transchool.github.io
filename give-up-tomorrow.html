                        <p><strong>Give Up Tomorrow</strong> is a documentary directed by Michael Collins. It was premiered during 2011/2012 and then becomes controversial nowadays because of the film Jacqueline Comes Home to be premiered this year, 2018. </p><p></p><p>You have to watch this crime and mystery documentary to be enlightened about our justice system or otherwise, loathe our justice system. Also, for you to reflect! How can you write a <strong>reflection paper about the Give Up Tomorrow </strong>if there’s nothing to be reflected on?</p><p></p><p>Here are the things about Give Up Tomorrow that you need to reflect about:</p><p></p><p>1.  If a well-off family cannot claim their rights and get the justice they deserve then how can the families in poverty that have no friends who can make them a documentary to enlighten people -?</p><p>2. Death Penalty. People are arguing these days about having death penalty again. Maybe some will change their minds after watching Give Up Tomorrow.</p><p>3. The Drug Lord.  Why is he still out there and not behind the bars? Power, money, bribery, government, police, and corruption.  Even our current administration is friendly to this drug lord.</p><p>4. Maybe the Chiong Family are victims too.  But where are they now?  Are they suffering like the innocent guy in detention?</p><p>5. “Thou shalt not bear false witness”</p><p>6. 21 years of injustice. Do we exist to just watch such documentary? Or do something? What are these “somethings”?</p><p>7. “It’s a shame. But nobody cares” </p><p>8. As a student, an ordinary citizen, what can I do to stop these power-hungry-made adversities from happening over and over and over again?</p><p>9. “If you want to give up then give up tomorrow. And when tomorrow comes, give up tomorrow again.”</p><p>10. There is still hope. I want to believe there is still hope. That justice will prevail.</p><p></p><p></p><p>So those are the points that might help you reassess and reflect.</p><p></p><p>When finalizing a reflection paper, remember you’re not just writing reactions about the subject (in your case, about Give Up Tomorrow documentary) but realizations and asking or seeking for actions and solutions.</p><p></p><p>This kind of paper is not just about criticizing (since it would have been easier if we’re just going to react on this story) but this is also about seeking resolutions.  You must have been enlightened and you must come up with an epiphany.</p><p></p><p>I hope this helped you. Good luck!</p><p></p><p>****</p><p></p><p>More info about the documentary / <strong>give up tomorrow story:</strong></p><p></p><p>This is a story about Paco Larrañaga who were falsely accused of the murder of two Tsinoy girls. Even though there sufficient and enough evidences and witnesses, the mestizo young guy was still taken into custody and faced death penalty. It was controversial during 1997 and then the books were re-opened during 2011/2012 when this documentary was premiered and these days in the year 2018. No matter how strong Larrañaga’s fight was, people and media were almost all anti-Paco. Journalism circus and back-door politics are the documentary’s examination of corrupt people and Philippines legislative system. People say this documentary is a “surreal world of the Philippines' crime and punishment”.</p><p></p><p><strong>Give Up Tomorrow Chiong Sisters: </strong>Marijoy and Jacqueline Chiong.  Dionisio Chiong who is the father of Marijoy and Jacqueline was due to testify against his boss, a powerful drug lord in the Philippines (still powerful up to this day).  He backed out when he learned his daughters were missing.</p><p></p><p>***</p><p></p><p>Related links:</p><p><strong>Give meaning in every letter "JUSTICE"<br />  - https://brainly.ph/question/463462</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Ano ang ibig sabihin ng katarungan (Justice)?<br /> - https://brainly.ph/question/1062406</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Ano ang katarungan? paano ito naging mahalagang sangkap ng ugnayan sa lipunan?<br /> - https://brainly.ph/question/268422</strong></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            3. reflection about give up tomorrow</h2><br />
                        <p>The documentary “Give up tomorrow” is another side of the coin. This time, from the accused’s point of view, Paco Larrañaga. It is making its rounds again all over social media, as a movie entitled “Jacqueline comes home” is being shown as a tribute for the 21st year of the Chiong sisters’ disappearance. </p><br /><p>The first time I watched it, I was in awe, but not in a good way. I mean, I know that money can move mountains and such, as from what I always see in movies and teleseryes but I just couldn’t believe that it’s actually possible in real life, justice that is being bought and manipulated by the rich and wealthy. The sad part is, it seemed like a lot of people has chosen to turn a blind eye. Though we are not sure about the suspect’s innocence, the evidences show otherwise. There were testimonies from actual people. How can persons with authority let this pass? Knowing that you have put an innocent man behind bars, and let the real culprit roam is enough to give you nightmares (The judge who has given the guilty verdict committed suicide a few days after). His conscience probably couldn’t take it.</p><br /><p>To me, the short was a voiceless plea for anyone who is willing to listen. I admire Paco for his tenacity and will to hold on and believe that one day, everything will be cleared up. I hope he receives what he really deserves and that the government will think of reopening his case so the truth will be finally revealed. </p><br /><br />

                        <p>As a tropical storm beats down on the island of Cebu, two sisters leave work and never make it home... Simultaneously a murder-mystery and an exposé of endemic corruption in the Philippines today, GIVE UP TOMORROW looks intimately at the case of Paco Larrañaga, a student accused of killing two sisters in July 1997. In a way that is both specific to the country and disquietingly universal, the film exposes a Kafkaesque extravaganza populated by flamboyantly crooked public officials, cops on the take, and a frenzied legal and media circus. GIVE UP TOMORROW is also an intimate family drama focused on the near mythic struggle of two angry, sorrowful mothers who have dedicated more than a decade to executing or saving one young man.</p><br />

                        <p>When I watched the documentary, Give Up Tomorrow, about the convicted Paco Larrañaga, at first I was honestly bothered by the justice served to him and the rest of the suspects. Although this documentary only focuses on Paco, and not so familiar with the other side of the story (Chiong Family's side), however, the witnesses' (Paco's)  statements were believable and Rusia's side, as the star witness, was a bit lacking. If unfair justice was really served in this case, then it's saddening, and I believe, even it has been finalized by the Supreme Court, the truth should be heard by both parties.</p><br />

</p><p>- According to 35 witnesses, Paco Larranaga was miles away on a different island when the crimes happened. 
</p><p>- Even though there are a lot of evidences that proved that Paco Larranaga was innocent and was not involved in the crimes, he was still taken into custody and was sentenced death penalty through lethal injection. 
</p><p>- Six other boys in Cebu were also arrested. There were also no evidences linking them to the said crimes. 
</p><p>- The documentary features how politics and media reflect how corrupt and imperfect the legislative system of the Philippines is. 
</p><p>Hope that this can assist you in creating your reaction paper. Example of a commentary may be “It is very sad and disappointing to witness that the justice system in the Philippines is screwed up, and this corrupted system may victimize anyone. I believe that fixing the judicial system of the country should be given utmost priority, alongside other pressing issues such as poverty and environmental issues.”
</p><p>Additional information: 
</p><p>Various documentary<strong> reviews on Give Up Tomorrow</strong> tell that the documentary exposes a shocking revelation regarding the corruption within the judicial system of the Philippines.  
</p><p>The filmmakers are spearheading a massive human rights campaign worldwide to plead the release of Paco Larranaga who was transferred from New Bilibid Prison in Muntinlupa City to Soto del Real, Madrid, Spain in 2009. The transfer was in line with a Treaty of Sentenced Persons signed between the Philippines and Spain.

                        <p>At first I was clueless about this documentary, until I saw it. I was still at a very young age when the case of the Chiong sisters and the conviction of Paco Larrañaga broke out the news in the 90s. We have heard both sides, but Paco’s side really struck me. </p><p></p><p>There are always two sides in every story, but the truth is somewhere in the middle of these stories. However, this documentary (Give Up Tomorrow) is more convincing (for me) than the story of the alleged victims. To be honest, I was a bit bothered by the Chiong family, and the sincerity is quite uncertain. I think if justice was wrongly served in this case, at least part of the truth may be heard and known to the public, even if the final decision was already made. </p><br />
