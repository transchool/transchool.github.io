The teacher as the teacher who taught Alexander expressed her <strong>deepest feelings</strong> in the letter.  None other than to motivate and strengthen Mrs. Michelle so that she can always guide her daughter.</p><p></p><p>As a teacher, of course the teacher wants her students to be <strong>pleasant</strong> <strong>individuals</strong> and to be in the <strong>midst of society</strong>. She has taught Alexander for 1 semester. Alexander is a special school student with intellectual disabilities. Mrs. Michelle hopes that in the end she can say proudly, that's my daughter, to people.</p><p></p><p>The activity of writing letters to parents and teachers is a form of expression of what is felt. Teachers and parents share <strong>gratitude</strong> and <strong>hope</strong> for each other. We want good communication between teachers and parents.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>The only relationship that a mother’s letter would be all about love. Our mothers basically offered their life to us the moment that we are born. They had carried us for nine months, experienced all kinds of feelings and hardships throughout those months. By the time that we are ready to be taken out from their womb, half of their life is at stake. That is how amazing our mothers are. Not only that, but the moment we are born they are the one who is going to feed us our very first food. Our mothers are the person who would sacrifice their own happiness for our own happiness. Some mothers are strict some were not but their common denominator would be the unconditional love in which this letter is an example of it. The letter basically describes how our mothers love us in their own special way.                </p><p></p><p>They also serve as our first teacher along with our fathers. They both work hand in hand to build us up and help us to become a better person someday. Our mothers are also the only person who is not going to judge us with whoever we want to be in our lives. They are our protector, and they would often cheer us up when we are down and be the first person to be proud of us with every successful endeavour that we have taken.  </p><p></p><p>Our mothers committed their lives just to help us have a future that we want. Their endless sacrifice and love would be priceless. This definitely is the how the letter describes, and it clearly shows that no one can ever match the love of mothers to their child.</p><p></p><br />
