       ' Better World'
I dream that one day
Our voices will somehow fill the earth
With joy forever
I dream that someday
Our wishes will somehoe soon come true and last forever
I dream that one day our songs in some way
Will bring a bright tomorrow
Full of love
Full of hope full of joy
I see this one day
When all the world will hear us
That someday when all will stand before us
Singing one song together
Everywhere singing
We are gonna love you, people of the wirld
We are gonna make you a better world
We will all respect you, people of the world
We are gonna make you a better world.</a>

But watching you stand alone
All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow
One step closer
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
Time stands still
Beauty in all she is
I will be brave
I will not let anything take away
What's standing in front of me
Every breath
Every hour has come to this
One step closer
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
One step closer
One step closer
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

No one lives, only for oneself
No one dies, only for themselves
We are all responsible for one another
God has called us all
With him
In our love and service
For whom
We will bring salvation news
We are all responsible for one another
God has called us all
With him
Sing together
The countries
We are considered masters
As children
We are all responsible for one another
God has called us all
With him
We are all responsible for one another
God has called us all
With him</a>

Colors and promises
How to be brave?
How can I love when I'm afraid to fall?
But watching you stand alone
All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow
One step closer
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
Time stands still
Beauty in all she is
I will be brave
I will not let anything take away
What's standing in front of me
Every breath
Every hour has come to this
One step closer
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
One step closer
One step closer
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

A. SAPPHO
B. ALCAEUS
C. STESICHORUS</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>A. SAPPHO - </strong>Sappho was an Archaic Greek poet from Eresos or Mytilene on the island of Lesbos. Sappho is known for her lyric poetry, written to be sung while accompanied by music. In ancient times, Sappho was widely regarded as one of the greatest lyric poets and was given names such as the "Tenth Muse" and "The Poetess". Most of Sappho's poetry is now lost, and what is extant has mostly survived in fragmentary form; only the "Ode to Aphrodite" is certainly complete. As well as lyric poetry, ancient commentators claimed that Sappho wrote elegiac and iambic poetry. Three epigrams attributed to Sappho are extant, but these are actually Hellenistic imitations of Sappho's style.</p><p></p><br />
