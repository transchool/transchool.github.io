                        <p>As a society, we have embraced social media as a means of communication and connection. However, the potential negative effects of excessive social media usage cannot be ignored.</p><p></p><p>While social media can facilitate communication and promote the sharing of ideas, it can also lead to a lack of face-to-face communication and loss of privacy. The constant need for validation and the pressure to present a perfect online persona can also lead to mental health issues such as depression and anxiety.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, the spread of fake news and misinformation on social media platforms has become a major concern. This can lead to the proliferation of harmful beliefs and actions, and can even impact the outcome of elections.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the monopolization of the social media industry by a few large companies has raised concerns about censorship and the potential manipulation of public opinion.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, it is important for individuals to carefully consider the potential negative effects of social media and to use it responsibly. It is also crucial for government regulators to ensure that social media companies are held accountable for their actions and are not able to abuse their power.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, while social media can be a valuable tool, its potential negative effects cannot be ignored. It is important for individuals and regulators to take action to address these issues and to promote responsible usage of social media</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Here’s what I noticed when looking at my own relationships. Those that were heavily based in contact through social media outlets were much less substantial than those relationships where we kept in touch in person, over the phone, or via email on a regular basis. How those deeper relationships are maintained varied mostly based on physical distance.</p><p></p><p>For example, I have plenty of colleagues I consider friends. Many of them I keep in touch with solely through Twitter, social networks like LinkedIn, and blog comments. Those relationships tend to be much more casual, and we tend to know much less about each other. Once we hit the phase of emailing each other though, things change. Those relationships were much deeper than the social media based ones. We could have more private conversations. We could have longer conversations. And I found that people tended to open up much more about things unrelated to work via email than they did in social media.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. I feel sad that some people waste their time on social media. </p><p><strong>Answer: Sad emoji</strong>
</p><p>2. Parents feel happy when they bond with their children. </p><p><strong>Answer: Happy emoji</strong>
</p><p>3. Reading books is better than playing mobile games.
</p><p><strong>Answer: Happy emoji</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>Adjectives </strong>are words that describe the qualities or states of being of nouns: enormous, doglike, silly, yellow, fun, fast. They can also describe the quantity of nouns: many, few, millions, eleven.</p><p></p>DIFFERENT TYPES OF ADJECTIVESDescriptive Adjectives<p>A descriptive adjective is a word which describes nouns and pronouns. Most of the adjectives belong in this type. These adjectives provide information and attribute to the nouns/pronouns they modify or describe. Descriptive adjectives are also called qualitative adjectives.</p><p>Examples:
</p>I have a <strong>fast </strong>car.  I am <strong>hungry</strong>.  I saw a <strong>flying </strong>Eagle.<p>
</p>
Quantitative Adjectives<p>A quantitative adjective provides information about the quantity of the nouns/pronouns. This type belongs to the question category of ‘how much’ and ‘how many’.
</p><p>
Examples:
</p>
I have <strong>20 </strong>bucks in my wallet. (How much)
They have <strong>three </strong>children. (How many)
You should have completed the <strong>whole </strong>task.
<p></p>Proper Adjectives<p>Proper adjectives are the adjective form of proper nouns. When proper nouns modify or describe other nouns/pronouns, they become proper adjectives. ‘Proper’ means ‘specific’ rather than ‘formal’ or ‘polite.’</p><p>Example:
</p><p>
<strong>American </strong>cars are very strong.
</p><p><strong>Chinese </strong>people are hard workers.
</p><p>I love <strong>KFC </strong>burgers.</p><p>
</p>Demonstrative Adjectives<p>A demonstrative adjective directly refers to something or someone. It works alone and does not precede a noun, but a demonstrative adjective always comes before the word it modifies.</p><p>Examples:
</p><p>
<strong>That </strong>house is so gorgeously decorated.  </p><p><strong>This</strong> bike<strong> </strong>car is mine.</p><p><strong>These</strong> bracelets are cute. </p><p>
</p>Possessive Adjectives<p>A possessive adjective indicates possession or ownership. It suggests the belongingness of something to someone/something.</p><p>Examples:
</p><p>
<strong>My </strong>car is parked outside.
</p><p><strong>His </strong>cat is very cute.
</p><p><strong>Our </strong>job is almost done.</p><p>
</p>Interrogative Adjectives<p>An interrogative adjective asks a question. An interrogative adjective must be followed by a noun or a pronoun. </p><p>Examples:
</p><p>
<strong>Which </strong>phone do you use?
</p><p><strong>What </strong>game do you want to play?
</p><p><strong>Whose </strong>car is this?
</p><p>
</p>Indefinite Adjectives<p>An indefinite adjective describes or modifies a noun unspecifically. They provide indefinite/unspecific information about the noun.</p><p>Examples:
</p><p>
I gave <strong>some </strong>candy to her.
</p><p>I want a <strong>few </strong>moments alone.
</p><p><strong>Several </strong>writers wrote about the recent incidents.</p><p></p><p>Adjective is a part of sentence.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Transitional devices are like bridges between parts of your paper. They are cues that help the reader to interpret ideas a paper develops. Transitional devices are words or phrases that help carry a thought from one sentence to another, from one idea to another, or from one paragraph to another. And finally, transitional devices link sentences and paragraphs together smoothly so that there are no abrupt jumps or breaks between ideas.
</p><p>
</p><p>There are several types of transitional devices, and each category leads readers to make certain connections or assumptions. Some lead readers forward and imply the building of an idea or thought, while others make readers compare ideas or draw conclusions from the preceding thoughts.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>paki brain list</p><br />
