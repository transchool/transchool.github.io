                                            activity 6.2 alkanes - the saturated hydrocarbons Answer the following questions:1. Why can carbon form numerous and varied organic compound?Ans: Carbon is the only element that can form so many different compounds because each carbon atom can form four chemical bonds to other atoms, and because the carbon atom is just the right, small size to fit in comfortably as parts of very large molecules. ... They can even join "head-to-tail" to make rings of carbon atoms.2. Give two  reasons for: the existence of carbon compounds.A and B: Carbon is the only element that can form so many different compounds because each carbon atom can form four chemical bonds to other atoms, and because the carbon atom is just the right, small size to fit in comfortably as parts of very large molecules3. Differentiate saturated from unsaturated hydrocarbons.Saturated Hydrocarbons — contain only carbon- carbon single bonds. Unsaturated Hydrocarbons — contain carbon- carbon double or triple bonds (more hydrogens can be added).4. Give the advantages and disadvantages of using plastic.The advantages of plastics: It is durable, low cost, water resistant, lesser energy and heavy chemicals requirements in manufacture and are light weight.  The disadvantages of plastics: Plastics bags are make of a non-renewable resource, which gives us more reasons to use recyclable shopping bags.Hope it helps​</a>

5. Why do you think massive star has shorter life span than average star?</h2><br />
                        <p></p><p>[tex]ANSWER:[/tex]</p>ABCAAC (nuclear fusion)ACCDAAABC<p></p>Hydrogen gas is typically the element from space that is pulled by gravity and turns into a protostar.When a low massive main sequence star runs out of hydrogen fuel, it will eventually shrink and cool, becoming a white dwarf.Heavy elements such as Carbon, Oxygen, and Neon are formed during star formation through the process of nuclear fusion in the cores of stars, where lighter elements are fused together to form heavier ones.It is impossible for any matter such as light and radiation to escape from a black hole because of its immense gravitational pull, which is so strong that it warps the fabric of spacetime itself, creating an event horizon beyond which anything that crosses it can no longer escape.Massive stars have shorter life spans than average stars because they burn through their fuel much faster, producing intense radiation and eventually exploding as supernovae, which disperse their elements into the surrounding space. This process is more intense in massive stars due to their higher temperatures and densities, leading to a shorter lifespan.<p></p><p>SOURCE:https://openai.com</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            16. activity 6.2 alkanes - the saturated hydrocarbons Answer the following questions:1. Why can carbon form numerous and varied organic compound?Ans: Carbon is the only element that can form so many different compounds because each carbon atom can form four chemical bonds to other atoms, and because the carbon atom is just the right, small size to fit in comfortably as parts of very large molecules. ... They can even join "head-to-tail" to make rings of carbon atoms.2. Give two  reasons for: the existence of carbon compounds.A and B: Carbon is the only element that can form so many different compounds because each carbon atom can form four chemical bonds to other atoms, and because the carbon atom is just the right, small size to fit in comfortably as parts of very large molecules3. Differentiate saturated from unsaturated hydrocarbons.Saturated Hydrocarbons — contain only carbon- carbon single bonds. Unsaturated Hydrocarbons — contain carbon- carbon double or triple bonds (more hydrogens can be added).4. Give the advantages and disadvantages of using plastic.The advantages of plastics: It is durable, low cost, water resistant, lesser energy and heavy chemicals requirements in manufacture and are light weight.  The disadvantages of plastics: Plastics bags are make of a non-renewable resource, which gives us more reasons to use recyclable shopping bags.Hope it helps​</h2><br />
