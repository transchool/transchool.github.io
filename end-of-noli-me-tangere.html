                                            JOSE RIZAL Jose Rizal was born on June 19, 1861 in Calamba, Laguna, Philippines as Jose Protacio Rizal Mercado Y Alonso Realonda. He was a writer, known for El Filibusterismo (1962), Sisa (1951) and Noli Me Tangere (1930). He died on December 30, 1896 in Bagumbayan (now Luneta), Manila, Philippines. He was a skilled linguist; in his many travels in Europe and Asia, he was able to pick up the language of whatever country he visited and stayed for a protracted amount of time. He was also a talented artist, and there are sketches of his work which are still intact today. He was married to an Irish woman, Josephine Bracken, toward the end of his life. They had a son, but he died shortly after birth. Before he was executed on 30 December 1894, he requested to be shot facing the firing squad, and this had denied him, so they shot him in the back. Despite this, after the squad opened fire, Rizal summoned his strength and turned to face the soldiers, and then fell flat on his back with his eyes looking in the sky. 1.

                        <p>This is the ending of <strong>"Noli Me Tangere"</strong> :</p><p><strong>Basilio,</strong> who is <strong>still a youngster </strong>at the conclusion of Noli Me Tangere, is devastated by the death of his cherished mother, Sisa. At this point, a man who has been badly hurt approaches him. The man asks Basilio to construct a pyre out of firewood. After that, light it on fire while Sisa and him are on it. Basilio is gathering wood for the bonfire while the man murmurs:</p><p>“I die without seeing dawn’s light shining on my country…You, who will see it, welcome it for me…don’t forget those who fell during the nighttime.”</p><p><strong>According to legend,</strong> Elias, a revolutionary leader of the Filipino people who was prepared to die for his nation, approached Basilio. B<strong>asilio decides to</strong> study medicine in El Filibusterismo. His intelligence is well renowned. Even though he initially hesitated, he ultimately decided to back Simoun's attempt to establish a revolution. <strong>Elias continued</strong> to exist in a way via him.</p><p><strong>Jose Rizal</strong>, like the injured man, <strong>passed away</strong> before witnessing his nation's independence from the Spanish. He encourages us to embrace the light blazing on our nation—our independence, a future, and hope—through the quote. He also cautions us not to forget those who died at night. The list includes Jose Rizal, Marcelo H. del Pilar, and Andre Bonifacio. But, more than their names, we can learn from their lives.</p><p><strong>The narrator provides</strong> updates on the lives of numerous individuals in the novel's epilogue. After Mara Clara enters the convent, Father Dámaso and Father Salv depart for Manila in the hopeless hope of being appointed bishop. Father Dámaso later receives an order from Father Salv to serve in a far-off province, and the news so upsets him that he passes away that night. <strong>Captain Tiago becomes</strong> an opium addict as a result of being extremely saddened by Maria Clara's decision to become a nun. Father Salv takes over as head priest of Mara Clara's convent after the ensign departs for Spain, leaving Doa Consolación behind. It is implied that he rapes Maria Clara, and despite her attempts to get assistance from the authorities, they ignore her—yet another example of how the ecclesiastical hierarchy is tainted.</p><p></p><p>For another answer for ending of Noli Me Tangere, click the link below.</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/6404770</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />

                            4. JOSE RIZAL Jose Rizal was born on June 19, 1861 in Calamba, Laguna, Philippines as Jose Protacio Rizal Mercado Y Alonso Realonda. He was a writer, known for El Filibusterismo (1962), Sisa (1951) and Noli Me Tangere (1930). He died on December 30, 1896 in Bagumbayan (now Luneta), Manila, Philippines. He was a skilled linguist; in his many travels in Europe and Asia, he was able to pick up the language of whatever country he visited and stayed for a protracted amount of time. He was also a talented artist, and there are sketches of his work which are still intact today. He was married to an Irish woman, Josephine Bracken, toward the end of his life. They had a son, but he died shortly after birth. Before he was executed on 30 December 1894, he requested to be shot facing the firing squad, and this had denied him, so they shot him in the back. Despite this, after the squad opened fire, Rizal summoned his strength and turned to face the soldiers, and then fell flat on his back with his eyes looking in the sky. 1.

How did he learn the different languages?___He received his informal education from his mother and his private tutors (1861-1870). On board the ship to Europe was a Japanese journalist who knew no other language than his own and Rizal acted as his interpreter. Is Betty White close to her stepchildren? He could converse in more than 10 different tongues.________ 3. What point of view did the writer use in this selection?__________________ 4. What is the purpose of the author in writing the story?_____________ 5. If you were Jose Rizal, would you do the same as he did for the country? ____If I were Dr. Jose Rizal, then I already had. And my only regret, to paraphrase, is that I only have one life to give to my country. Unless I’m Sylvester, then I’ll have nine.</p><p></p><p>But the bigger disappointment would be that Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo are more widely accepted, appreciated and studied abroad than in my own country. That the youth of my country doesn’t understand what sacrifice and patriotism are all about. As I look around my country today, all I see are more foreign cultural influences and less of my country’s.________.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Sorry ung 3 and 4 ikaw nakakaalam nyan kase ikaw ung nag basa nyan eh</p><br />

                        Magmula ng pumasok sa kumbento si Maria, nanirahan na si Padre Damaso sa Maynila. Di nagtagal, aiya ay inilipat ng padre provincial sa isang malayong probinsiya. Kinabukasan, siya ay nakitang bangkay sa kanyang higaan. Sa pagsusuri ng doktor, sama ng loob o bangungot ang sanhi ng kanyang ikinamatay.<br /><br />Sa kabilang dako, si Pari Salvi habang hinihintay niya ang pagiging obispo ay nanungkulan pansamantala sa kumbento ng Sta. Clarang pinasukan ni Maria Clara. Kasunod nito ay umalis na rin sa San Diego at nanirahan na sa Maynila.<br /><br />Ilang linggo naman bago naging ganap na mongha si Maria, si Kapitan Tiyago ay dumanas ng sapin-saping paghihirap ng damdamin, nangayayat ng husto, naging mapag-isip at nawalan ng tiwala sa mga kainuman. Pagkagaling niya sa kumbento, sinabihan niya si Tiya Isabel na umuwi na ito sa Malabon o sa San Diego sapagkat gusto na lamang mabuhay mag-isa. Ang lahat ng mga santo at santang kanyang pinipintakasi at nalimot na niya. Ang kanyang inaatupag ay ang paglalaro ng liyempo, sabong at paghitit ng marijuana. Madalas tuwing takip-silim ay makikita siya sa tindahan ng intsik sa Sto. Cristo. Di nagtagal, napapayaan niya ang kanyang katawan at kabuhayan. Ang kanyang dating marangyang tahanan ay mayroong nakasulat sa pintuan na: Fumadero Publico de Anfion. Ganap na siyang nalimot ng mga tao. Wala ni isa mang nakakaalala sa kanya, siya na isang tanyag at dating iginagalang.<br /><br />Nagdagdag ng mga kulot sa ulo si Donya Victorina upang mapagbuti ang pagbabalatkayo niyang siya’y taga-Andalucia. Siya ngayon ang nangungutsero. Si Don Tiburcio ay hindi na niya pinakikilos. Nagsasalamin na ito. Hindi na rin siya natatawag bilang "doktor" para mag-gamot. Wala na rin siyang ngipin.<br />
