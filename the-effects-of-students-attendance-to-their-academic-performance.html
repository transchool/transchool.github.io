                                            The study was conducted in the secondary schools in Nigeria. To guide the investigation the researcher raised research question and formulated onehypothesis in the study. A sample of fifty-six schools was selected from a total population of 278 schools in the Delta North Senatorial District through the stratified random technique. In these fifty-six schools, there was a total of 5,315 staff from which respondents were drawn. Twenty per cent of the targetpopulation was the subject of the study.A questionnaire was used in collecting data which were analyzed using percentage and Z-test statistic. The result of the findings revealed that humanresources undergo different forms of training. The result also revealed that there is a significance difference between the performances of human resourcesin relation to students' academic performance. It was therefore concluded that school personnel should undergo training and attend regular workshops and seminars. Also that the performances of human resources have considerable effects on students' academic performance. The researcher thereforerecommended that the human resources in schools who are not trained professional staff should be advised to go for Post Graduate Diploma in Education to acquire teaching skills. They should be made to understand the importance of appropriate teaching methods for specific subject areas as they help thestaff perform more effectively1. What was investigated?a.

                            6. Study 1. The researcher wishes to study the value of a workshop on sulcide prevention for high school students. The workshop is to consist of three 2-hour meetings in which danger signals, causes of suicide, and community resources that provide counseling will be discussed. Students will volunteer, and half will be assigned to a comparison group that will not partidpate in the workshop. Outcomes will be assessed by comparing the Information learned and attitudes of those attending the meetings with those who do not attend. LE The 40 - Study 2 The researcher plans to observe (unobtrusively) students in each of classrooms-elght visits each of 40 minutes' duration. The purpose of these observations is to look for relationships between the behavior of students and certain teacher behavior patterns.

A sample of fifty-six schools was selected from a total population of 278 schools in the Delta North Senatorial District through the stratified random technique. In these fifty-six schools, there was a total of 5,315 staff from which respondents were drawn. Twenty per cent of the targetpopulation was the subject of the study.A questionnaire was used in collecting data which were analyzed using percentage and Z-test statistic. The result of the findings revealed that humanresources undergo different forms of training.
