The decisions that you made these months had a great impact on you right now. Also, not only you are affected but the people around you. Some decisions broke you but some made you a better person. A lot of these hurt you and you are in a lot of pain right now.  </p><p></p><p>But you're a good person, and you might be hurt right now but keep in mind that mistakes are not there for nothing. Bad decisions help you realize that you can do better. Try to think a couple of times more before coming up to making decisions. Never make decisions when your emotions are not stable. It means that you should never make decisions when you're too much happy, sad and mad. lastly, always think of the impact that your decision will ring to yourself and the people around you.</p><p></p><p>Above all this, you are doing great and never be afraid of making excuses. No one's perfect and mistakes allow you to learn and improve so you can be a better person.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope its help</p><p>have a nice day</p><p>hàppy néw yéàr</p><br />
