A researcher wants to determine the effect of different concentrations of marigold extract on egg yolk color samples. He expects that the higher the concentration of marigold extract fed to chickens, the brighter the color of the egg yolk would be. To test this hypothesis, 13 chickens of the same age and health condition were fed daily with polished rice mixed with varied concentrations (25%, 50%, 75% and 100%) of marigold extract within 45 days. To achieve the concentration, marigold extracts were diluted in distilled water. Three chickens were used for each concentration. The last chicken was fed with polished rice only. All chickens were placed under the same conditions of temperature and amount of light. After the said experiment, the chickens laid eggs and the color of their yolks were compared.

                            12. Instructions: Read carefully the situation given below. Then, supply the needed information to completely design the experiment.
A researcher wants to determine the effect of different concentrations of marigold extract on egg yolk color samples. He expects that the higher the concentration of marigold extract fed to chickens, the brighter the color of the egg yolk would be. To test this hypothesis, 13 chickens of the same age and health condition were fed daily with polished rice mixed with varied concentrations (25%, 50%, 75% and 100%) of marigold extract within 45 days. To achieve the concentration, marigold extracts were diluted in distilled water. Three chickens were used for each concentration. The last chicken was fed with polished rice only. All chickens were placed under the same conditions of temperature and amount of light. After the said experiment, the chickens laid eggs and the color of their yolks were compared.
