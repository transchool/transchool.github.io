                                            Why Pinoy students ranked last in reading comprehension surveyMANILA - Filipino students ranked last among 79 countries in a global survey of reading comprehension because they are more used to narrative instead of informative text materials, a group said Thursday:Frederick Sotto Perez, president of the Reading Association of the Philippines, said this was the first time that the country joined the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).The country joined the global survey which will provide us baseline data for our curriculum," he said. "The texts in the exam) are mainly informational and the evaluation of the text and understanding revolved on informational text and not narrative, to which our students are used to in the Philippines," Perez told ANC's Early Edition"People are alarmed by the results. This alarm may lead us to a more reflective education which we went to pursue."Perez said children should be taught expository texts that focus on factual information, at the age of 9."Reading ability is developed through practice. We can only develop fluent readers if we provide them with text, print and digital, and we practice them through teacher modeling, shared practice towards independent practice, he said.Another reason for Filipino students tenking last in the exam is poor connectivity in far-flung areas, Perez said, noting that the country "lacks reading materials." There's no internet, boolas are mainly children's books, and there are noencyclopedias and other digital texts," he said."Books and printed text are very essential. Reading culture may be promoted in schools through extended literacy projects, book talks of teachers. Schools should be active in fostering a reading culture by actually making their libraries functional."Students must also be taught to discern the credibility of a text which was one aspect that PISA tested, Perez added."I think it's important we know how to evaluate sources, that is being taught in high school, check the facts and actually cross-check," he said."Even in social media, for example, we see our students always sharing online without discerning what kind of texts they are sharing with other people."Teachers and parents must also be guided in handling digital literacy Perez said as he emphasized that all educators should be "reading teachers.""All teachers should undergo reading instruction strategy training. Our students to be able to do research should know how to read articles and facts, evaluate them, citation, distinguishing fact from opinion," he said."But if our teachers for example in science, social studies, or math are not equipped in helping our students develop those skills, the blame goes to our reading teachers."what is your personal opinion towards the subject of the new article? cite you belief or opinions why you think filipino students ranked last in the reading comprehension survey.​</a>

Mothers and fathers, siblings and grandparents, plus members of an extended family, all teach a child what he or she needs to know. For example, they show the child how to use objects (such as clothes, computers, eating utensils, books, bikes); how to relate to others (some as “family,” others as “friends,” still others as “strangers” or “teachers” or “neighbors”); and how the world works (what is “real” and what is “imagined”).

Territory refers to the place where the people that compose the state are located and includes the land, natural resources and air spaces located within it. 5. Population is the institution empowered by the people to control and administer the state. It is through it that the will of the state is expressed and realized. 6. Lasswell (1936) described the study of politics as "who gets, what, when, and how” which was also the same title of his seminal book, Politics: Who Gets, What, When 7. Politics is not limited to the activity of the state and government but extends to include other institutions within the society such as the family, the church, and other parts of the society because politics is everywhere. 8. Politics helps you to know your rights. 9. Governance is the sound exercise of political, economic and administrative country's resources for development. It involves the institutionalization of a system through which citizens, institutions, organizations, and groups in a society articulate their interests, exercise their rights, and mediate their differences in pursuit of the collective good” (Country Governance Assessment, 2005) 10. All governing is an act of leadership, of moving a society towards a preferred direction. While government can have a connotation of being interested only in maintenance and in preserving peace and order, governance implies leadership toward and How a authority to manage societal development. 2​</h2><br />

                            10. Why Pinoy students ranked last in reading comprehension surveyMANILA - Filipino students ranked last among 79 countries in a global survey of reading comprehension because they are more used to narrative instead of informative text materials, a group said Thursday:Frederick Sotto Perez, president of the Reading Association of the Philippines, said this was the first time that the country joined the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).The country joined the global survey which will provide us baseline data for our curriculum," he said. "The texts in the exam) are mainly informational and the evaluation of the text and understanding revolved on informational text and not narrative, to which our students are used to in the Philippines," Perez told ANC's Early Edition"People are alarmed by the results. This alarm may lead us to a more reflective education which we went to pursue."Perez said children should be taught expository texts that focus on factual information, at the age of 9."Reading ability is developed through practice. We can only develop fluent readers if we provide them with text, print and digital, and we practice them through teacher modeling, shared practice towards independent practice, he said.Another reason for Filipino students tenking last in the exam is poor connectivity in far-flung areas, Perez said, noting that the country "lacks reading materials." There's no internet, boolas are mainly children's books, and there are noencyclopedias and other digital texts," he said."Books and printed text are very essential. Reading culture may be promoted in schools through extended literacy projects, book talks of teachers. Schools should be active in fostering a reading culture by actually making their libraries functional."Students must also be taught to discern the credibility of a text which was one aspect that PISA tested, Perez added."I think it's important we know how to evaluate sources, that is being taught in high school, check the facts and actually cross-check," he said."Even in social media, for example, we see our students always sharing online without discerning what kind of texts they are sharing with other people."Teachers and parents must also be guided in handling digital literacy Perez said as he emphasized that all educators should be "reading teachers.""All teachers should undergo reading instruction strategy training. Our students to be able to do research should know how to read articles and facts, evaluate them, citation, distinguishing fact from opinion," he said."But if our teachers for example in science, social studies, or math are not equipped in helping our students develop those skills, the blame goes to our reading teachers."what is your personal opinion towards the subject of the new article? cite you belief or opinions why you think filipino students ranked last in the reading comprehension survey.​</h2><br />
