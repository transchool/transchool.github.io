Wegener's curiosity about the idea of drifting continents started when he noticed the edges of South America and Eurasia in a world map could be fitted like a jigsaw puzzle. 2. The existence of coal deposits in Antarctica suggested that it was once located near the region of the Earth where the climate is enough to support complex life forms such as plants and tall trees. 3. The Cynognathus lived during the Early Permian period 286 to 258 million years ago. 4. The Glossopteris fossil is found in Australia, Antarctica, India, South Africa and South America.5. A magnetic compass can tell direction. 6. Rocks of the same age in the seafloor crust would have taken on the magnetic polarity at that part of the crust formed. 7. The magnetic reversal is also called as the magnetic flip. 8. Over the last 10 million years, there had been an average of 4 to 5 reversals per million years. 9. The occurrence of the magnetic reversal can be explained through the magnetic patterns in the magnetic rocks.10. The crystalized irons in rocks found in the seafloor act as a magnetic compass that can tell the earth's magnetic field direction.​</a>

The shifts of the ocean to be folded, lowering the sea level and deforming the surface of the ocean. produced which in turn trigger another series of waves in deep water far from t earthquake. The tsunami reaches a few thousand centimeters, but its height incre of the ocean floor rises. In extreme cases, the waves take on speed of 500 to 800 when the water is very deep, decreasing in speed to about 20 or 30 kilomete approach the coast. The waves can reach heights of up to 30 meters, breaking o intervals of 10 to 40 minutes sweeping away everything in their path.

The shifts of the ocean to be folded, lowering the sea level and deforming the surface of the ocean. produced which in turn trigger another series of waves in deep water far from t earthquake. The tsunami reaches a few thousand centimeters, but its height incre of the ocean floor rises. In extreme cases, the waves take on speed of 500 to 800 when the water is very deep, decreasing in speed to about 20 or 30 kilomete approach the coast. The waves can reach heights of up to 30 meters, breaking o intervals of 10 to 40 minutes sweeping away everything in their path.
