                                            Bert’s experienceBert was a young employee who had been working at “Dave’s Detailing” yard for a month.  His job was to clean the motors of cars using a product called “Acidic Detergent”.  Unknown to Bert, this product contained several hazardous substances and dangerous goods such as hydrofluoric acid, sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid. These substances are commonly used to detail (clean) cars. Bert had to empty the Acidic Detergent from a large drum into a small hand-held spray bottle.  He did this by dipping a pump into the drum and squirting a bit of the liquid into the spray bottle.  While doing this, Bert noticed that the fumes made his eyes and throat sore. He complained to his supervisor but he told him not to worry. When Bert sprayed the liquid onto the motors the dirt and grease came off really easily – often in a few minutes – it was GREAT stuff and seemed to make Bert’s job much easier.Bert was not provided with any protective equipment such as aprons or gloves.  Nor was he told that the Acidic Detergent was capable of causing serious burns if it came into contact with his skin. One day Bert was working, dressed in a tee-shirt, shorts and thongs as usual, when he spilled some of the liquid on his foot.  Bert wandered off and rinsed the Acidic Detergent off.  Unfortunately, it was too late.  Although the skin did not feel that it was burning, it had gradually caused severe burns to his flesh and he had to be hospitalized. The injury was reported to WorkSafe.  After an investigation into its causes, Bert’s boss was prosecuted.Bert’s employer should have:Your answer:Bert’s supervisor should have:Your answer:Bert should have:.your answers: ​</a>

A. My Dog Hark is so much fun to play with. One reason he is fun is because he loves to play catch.
What’s also fun is that he follows me around the house with a toy and drops it on my foot, so I will kick it.
Additionally, he can catch just about anything, but his favorite thing to catch is a Frisbee. Finally, he loves it
when I pretend like I’m falling dead, and he runs over to lick me. All these reasons show why I really have fun
playing with Hark.

                            9. Bert’s experienceBert was a young employee who had been working at “Dave’s Detailing” yard for a month.  His job was to clean the motors of cars using a product called “Acidic Detergent”.  Unknown to Bert, this product contained several hazardous substances and dangerous goods such as hydrofluoric acid, sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid. These substances are commonly used to detail (clean) cars. Bert had to empty the Acidic Detergent from a large drum into a small hand-held spray bottle.  He did this by dipping a pump into the drum and squirting a bit of the liquid into the spray bottle.  While doing this, Bert noticed that the fumes made his eyes and throat sore. He complained to his supervisor but he told him not to worry. When Bert sprayed the liquid onto the motors the dirt and grease came off really easily – often in a few minutes – it was GREAT stuff and seemed to make Bert’s job much easier.Bert was not provided with any protective equipment such as aprons or gloves.  Nor was he told that the Acidic Detergent was capable of causing serious burns if it came into contact with his skin. One day Bert was working, dressed in a tee-shirt, shorts and thongs as usual, when he spilled some of the liquid on his foot.  Bert wandered off and rinsed the Acidic Detergent off.  Unfortunately, it was too late.  Although the skin did not feel that it was burning, it had gradually caused severe burns to his flesh and he had to be hospitalized. The injury was reported to WorkSafe.  After an investigation into its causes, Bert’s boss was prosecuted.Bert’s employer should have:Your answer:Bert’s supervisor should have:Your answer:Bert should have:.your answers: ​</h2><br />

Directions: Read and analyze the paragraph below. Encircle the topic sentence, underline the supporting details and box
the concluding sentence.
A. My Dog Hark is so much fun to play with. One reason he is fun is because he loves to play catch.
What’s also fun is that he follows me around the house with a toy and drops it on my foot, so I will kick it.
Additionally, he can catch just about anything, but his favorite thing to catch is a Frisbee. Finally, he loves it
when I pretend like I’m falling dead, and he runs over to lick me. All these reasons show why I really have fun
playing with Hark.
