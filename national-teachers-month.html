                                            II. TAKE MY ORDER Directions: Arrange the following paragraphs from A to E to form an introduction. A. Absenteeism among Fourth Year Students of Lipa City National High School ______1. In Lipa City National High School, about 6.34 percent or 60 out of 946 fourth year students are habitually absent during the month of August, September and October. _____2. The frequent absences of the students affect their academic performance therefore, in order to identify the possible causes of absences among fourth year students and to minimize truancy, the researcher conducts an investigation. _____3. Student absenteeism (McCluskey et. al., 2005) is a strong predictor of undesirable outcomes in adolescence, including academic failure, dropping out of school, substance abuse, gang involvement, and criminal activity. However, absenteeism is increasingly identified as an important "early warning sign" that a student is at risk for school failure and early dropout. ______4. As shown by the Guidance office records, a recorded number of absences everyday range to a total of 25 to 35 students. This is alarming on the part of the teachers and administrators since they are graduating students._____ 5. Absenteeism is a very alarming problem for administrators, teachers, parents and the society in general, as well as for the students in particular. As a result, students who are not able to finish their studies may end up as a liability of the community and the country as a whole.​</a>

                                            Mapalo: The struggle is real: Depressing yet hopefulJuly 3, 2020 Sunstar Daily BaguioIt's been almost four months now since the government announced a national quarantineThese are supposed to be Baguio's peak season for tourists. Last year, the number of tourist arrivalsfor these four months (March to June), as per submitted hotel check-in data, was 517.107. Andconsidering a survey that says each tourist spends P2,700 per visit, per person, we can estimate thatP1.4 billion of potential gross tourist receipts did not come in this year. That amount could have beenwhat went to the salaries of employees and income of tourism businesses and their suppliers, spreadacross different sectors including the events, entertainment, and creative sectors.In a life-changing moment, the city that thrived and prospered as a popular tourist destinationis suddenly struggling. No tourists mean no business, no income, no livelihood. From accommodationestablishments alone, around 4,000 employees are affected and fearing possible retrenchment VictoryLiner, a tourism partner of North Luzon destinations, has already laid off 400 employees. In BurnhamPark, there are around 250 concessioners, aides, vendors, guides and photographers, who currentlyhave no source of income. According to DOT-CAR OIC Jovi Ganongan. 12 ESL (English as SecondLanguage) schools, now recognized as a growing tourism sector with foreign students as their market,had displaced 1,048 teachers and employees.The Baguio Tourism Council is conducting a survey that will assess the impact of thispandemic to tourism-oriented establishments. And so far, 33 businesses are saying that they will haveno other option but to shut down operations. One of our favorite home-grown restaurants, ForestHouse Bistro and Café, which closed recently, may just be the tip of the iceberg.Yes, the struggle is real. Employment, livelihood, and business revenue are at an all-time low.And the effect will trickle down to city revenue - no business means no taxes. Even the PhilippineNational Police looked at it from a different perspective, unemployment could mean more crimes.Depressing times indeed.

                            4. II. TAKE MY ORDER Directions: Arrange the following paragraphs from A to E to form an introduction. A. Absenteeism among Fourth Year Students of Lipa City National High School ______1. In Lipa City National High School, about 6.34 percent or 60 out of 946 fourth year students are habitually absent during the month of August, September and October. _____2. The frequent absences of the students affect their academic performance therefore, in order to identify the possible causes of absences among fourth year students and to minimize truancy, the researcher conducts an investigation. _____3. Student absenteeism (McCluskey et. al., 2005) is a strong predictor of undesirable outcomes in adolescence, including academic failure, dropping out of school, substance abuse, gang involvement, and criminal activity. However, absenteeism is increasingly identified as an important "early warning sign" that a student is at risk for school failure and early dropout. ______4. As shown by the Guidance office records, a recorded number of absences everyday range to a total of 25 to 35 students. This is alarming on the part of the teachers and administrators since they are graduating students._____ 5. Absenteeism is a very alarming problem for administrators, teachers, parents and the society in general, as well as for the students in particular. As a result, students who are not able to finish their studies may end up as a liability of the community and the country as a whole.​</h2><br />

You are the lawyer Ang member of court jury.as the part of the new issues of the magazine to be published by the national council of teacher for mathematics next month, write a five paragraph essay that discusses the process of Hypothesis testing in statistics and the process of making court decisions. please po pa help sana hindi galing sa internet​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>Hypothesis testing is a statistical process used to determine whether there is enough evidence in a sample of data to infer a certain conclusion about a population. The process begins with the formulation of a null hypothesis, which states that there is no significant difference or relationship between variables, and an alternative hypothesis, which states that there is a difference or relationship. The next step is to collect a sample of data and perform a statistical test to determine the likelihood of obtaining the sample results if the null hypothesis were true. The outcome of the test is then used to make a decision about whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.</p><p></p><p>The process of making court decisions is similar to hypothesis testing in that it also involves the weighing of evidence and the drawing of conclusions based on that evidence. In a court case, the prosecution presents its evidence to support its case, while the defense presents evidence to refute it. The jury, much like a hypothesis test, must then evaluate the evidence and make a decision about the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This decision is based on the principle of "beyond a reasonable doubt", which means that the jury must be convinced that the defendant is guilty to a moral certainty before returning a guilty verdict.</p><p></p><p>Both hypothesis testing and court decision making involve the evaluation of evidence and the drawing of conclusions based on that evidence. In hypothesis testing, the conclusion is whether or not to reject a null hypothesis, while in court decision making, the conclusion is whether or not the defendant is guilty. Both processes also involve the use of critical thinking and logical reasoning to evaluate the evidence and make a decision.</p><p></p><p>However, there are also some important differences between the two processes. For example, in hypothesis testing, the decision is based on a set level of significance, such as a p-value of less than 0.05, whereas in court decision making, the decision is based on the principle of "beyond a reasonable doubt". Additionally, in hypothesis testing, the decision is based on the analysis of a sample of data, whereas in court decision making, the decision is based on the analysis of all the evidence presented.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, hypothesis testing and court decision making are both processes that involve the evaluation of evidence and the drawing of conclusions based on that evidence. Both processes require critical thinking and logical reasoning, and both have a level of uncertainty. However, there are also important differences between the two, such as the level of significance and the scope of the evidence considered. As a lawyer and member of court jury, it is crucial to understand the similarities and differences between these processes to make well-informed decisions.</p>Answer:<p>Hypothesis testing in statistics is a process used to make inferences about a population based on a sample of data. The goal of hypothesis testing is to determine whether or not there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis, which is the assumption that there is no difference between the population and the sample.</p><p></p><p>The process of hypothesis testing begins with the formulation of a null hypothesis and an alternate hypothesis. The null hypothesis is typically a statement of no difference or no effect, while the alternate hypothesis is the opposite of the null hypothesis. Once the hypotheses are formulated, a test statistic is calculated using the sample data. This test statistic is then compared to a critical value to determine whether or not to reject the null hypothesis.</p><p></p><p>The process of making court decisions is similar to hypothesis testing in that both involve evaluating evidence to determine whether or not a particular claim is true. In a court of law, a judge or jury must evaluate evidence presented by both sides in order to make a decision. The judge or jury must weigh the evidence and decide whether or not the prosecution has provided enough evidence to prove the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p><p></p><p>There are many similarities between the process of hypothesis testing and the process of making court decisions. Both involve evaluating evidence and making a decision based on that evidence. However, there are also some important differences. In hypothesis testing, the goal is to determine whether or not there is enough evidence to reject a null hypothesis, while in court the goal is to determine whether or not the prosecution has proven their case beyond a reasonable doubt.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, hypothesis testing and court decisions are both processes that involve evaluating evidence and making a decision based on that evidence. Both processes are critical for determining the truth and making fair and just decisions. Understanding the similarities and differences between these two processes can help us better understand the nature of evidence and decision-making in general.</p><br />

Mapalo: The struggle is real: Depressing yet hopefulJuly 3, 2020 Sunstar Daily BaguioIt's been almost four months now since the government announced a national quarantineThese are supposed to be Baguio's peak season for tourists. Last year, the number of tourist arrivalsfor these four months (March to June), as per submitted hotel check-in data, was 517.107. Andconsidering a survey that says each tourist spends P2,700 per visit, per person, we can estimate thatP1.4 billion of potential gross tourist receipts did not come in this year. That amount could have beenwhat went to the salaries of employees and income of tourism businesses and their suppliers, spreadacross different sectors including the events, entertainment, and creative sectors.In a life-changing moment, the city that thrived and prospered as a popular tourist destinationis suddenly struggling. No tourists mean no business, no income, no livelihood. From accommodationestablishments alone, around 4,000 employees are affected and fearing possible retrenchment VictoryLiner, a tourism partner of North Luzon destinations, has already laid off 400 employees. In BurnhamPark, there are around 250 concessioners, aides, vendors, guides and photographers, who currentlyhave no source of income. According to DOT-CAR OIC Jovi Ganongan. 12 ESL (English as SecondLanguage) schools, now recognized as a growing tourism sector with foreign students as their market,had displaced 1,048 teachers and employees.The Baguio Tourism Council is conducting a survey that will assess the impact of thispandemic to tourism-oriented establishments. And so far, 33 businesses are saying that they will haveno other option but to shut down operations. One of our favorite home-grown restaurants, ForestHouse Bistro and Café, which closed recently, may just be the tip of the iceberg.Yes, the struggle is real. Employment, livelihood, and business revenue are at an all-time low.And the effect will trickle down to city revenue - no business means no taxes.

What tools, materials and ingredients will you prepare?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Contests make an opportunity to challenge yourself. It helps bring out the fullest of your potential -like how diamonds shine after exposed to pressure. Competitive situations train you not to break down under pressure which is a necessary skill when you enter a job.</p><p></p><p>Salad dressing is a sauce, which is used to make an entire salad tastier. A dressing is an oil-in-water emulsion and generally consists of a combination of oil, water, vinegar, citric acid, salt, spices and an emulsifier. A thickening agent, like xanthan gum or carrageenan, is often added to the low-fat salad dressings.</p><p></p><p>Clean your kitchen utensils in hot water with an antibacterial detergent. When sanitizing kitchen tools and equipment, use either boiling water or a solution of bleach and water. Store your tools in a regularly cleaned plastic or metal box to keep the germs away.</p><br />
