Did Rizal retract or did he not?</h2><br />
                        <strong>Retraction of Rizal:</strong><strong>Did Jose Rizal retract or did he not?</strong><p>The question above is the center of debate between two Rizalist groups. The Masonic Rizalists believe that Rizal did not retract all the things he wrote and did against the Spaniards.

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Yes,<strong>It was hoped by the ecclesiastical and civil authorities that Rizal's life would end with his death in Bagumbayan. But from the day of his execution to this day, Rizal has been in this country a living issue and often a burning one – the soul of contention between Catholics and freethinkers, a bone for the tug of war between church and state in the control of education, and the subject of bitter debate over the authenticity or fraudulence of his supposed retraction of his words and deeds.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Rizal's Retraction. A mjaor controversy about him, did he retract or not? Rizal fought the Spaniards through his writings. There is this priest that once said Rizal retracted because of Josephine (I don't remember the surname), because Rizal wanted to marry her but there is a comdition, he will retract. The priest (I don't also remember his name) said that he was the priest-in-charge for their marriage. However, there were no marriage certificate shown, therefore, it was a lie. And one more thing, if Rizal retracted, all of his hardworks to tell us about the cruelty of Spaniards to the Filipinos would all go to waste. He is loyal to his fellow Filipinos. So, did Rizal retracted? NO! </p><br />

Pi, who in turn submitted it to Archbishop Bernardino Nozaleda (Guerrero 1971, 459).</p><p>However, at the last hour, Rizal abjured, in writing, his religious errors.” In other words, Rizal, a Mason, was said to have recanted his statements against the Church and to have returned to the Catholic faith.

                            18. How did you feel that there is an issues that rizal retraction?</h2><br />
                        <p> Rizal’s extraction from religious error has been a very controversial claim since it was first brought up. In it, Rizal disowns all his life’s work. In the supposed retraction document, he is alleged to have written:</p><p></p><p>“I declare myself a Catholic and in this religion in which I was born and educated I wish to live and die. I retract with all my heart whatever in my words, writings, publications and conduct has been contrary to my character as son of the Catholic Church.”</p><p></p><p>This document is critical as Rizal became the inspiration of the Katipunan which advocated for Philippine Independence. Ironically enough, Rizal was not really pro-independence himself. He is aware that as of the time he was in, the people are not yet ready to launch a fight for independence and any attempt will just result in heavy losses and suffering to the people. He was an advocate of better treatment for the people, representation in the Spanish Cortes, and education for the people - presumably to better prepare the people for Independence. When the Katipunan visited him in Dapitan, he himself emphasized it to Dr. Pio Valenzuela. However, when pressed further, he advised that should a revolution be unavoidable, to at least have the rich be neutral as they could easily turn the tide on the revolutionaries. He even suggested that they contact his friend, Antonio Luna (who is also by then still pro reform instead of pro independence).</p><p></p><p>By showing a retraction document, the Spanish authorities are hoping that Rizal’s death will not become a rallying cry for the Filipinos in the quest for independence. They fear it so much that the authorities even broke a promise to the Rizal family to release the body to them after the execution and instead dumped his body on a secret, unmarked grave.</p><p></p><p>This document will also serve as a face saving measure for the friars whom Rizal made fun of and criticized in his novels. However, there has been no definitive proof whether this supposed retraction is real or not. While a copy of the original retraction document was supposedly found in the 1930’s, it could also be a forgery. Two other documents could also indirectly debunk the retraction:</p><p></p><p>The “Mi Ultimo Adios” - the person who supposedly witnessed the retraction, Fr. Balaguer, never mentioned Rizal writing the poem during Rizal’s last night</p><p>The marriage certificate - it was also claimed that upon retracting, Rizal married his sweetheart Josephine Bracken. Josephine’ whereabouts during the days of the execution is not known. If she was at his cell that night, it would have been noted by the guards and other people in the area. When Josephine was trying to claim Rizal’s library from his friend Jose Basa, she was asked to produce their marriage certificate as proof. She stopped the claim then, the assumption of which is that she can not produce any as there really was no marriage which puts into question the accounts made by Fr. Balaguer</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><br />

                        Yes, The flow of history is as inexorable as the tidal flow of an angry ocean. But ever so often in our collective recollection, it is remembered that sometimes the skilful use of forgery can redirect the flow of history itself. <br /><br />      In the Philippines today, forgery is usually resorted to redirect the flow of money from the rightful beneficiary to the unworthy pockets of invisible people. <br /><br />      That money is usually the target of forgery is known and practiced all over the world, but forgery in the hands of the wily, has power to effect a redirection of events and undoing of history. It has the power to obscure or beliee an occurrence or create an event that did not actually transpire.  It also has the power to enslave and destroy. <br /><br />      In October 1600, the Muslim Ottoman Army and a Christian army,  led by Austrians, with Hungarian, French, Maltese and German troops were battling it out for territory called Kanizsa. The Ottoman army was outgunned and outmanned, but the Ottoman commander, Tiryaki Hasan Pasha was a clever man. He knew that the Hungarians were not too happy to be allied with the Austrians. So he sent fake letters, designed them to be captured by the Austrians. The letters contained Hungarian alliance with Ottoman forces. The Austrian upon reading the fake letters signed by a reliable source (obviously forged) decided to kill all Hungarian soldiers.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Rizal’s retraction letter was discovered by Father Manuel Garcia, C.M. in 1935, its content has become a favorite subject of dispute among academicians and Catholics. The letter, dated December 29, 1896, was said to have been signed by the National Hero himself.
</p><p>
According to research, it stated: “I declare myself a Catholic and in this religion in which I was born and educated I wish to live and die. I retract with all my heart whatever in my words, writings, publications, and conduct has been contrary to my character as the son of the Catholic Church.
</p><p><strong>Explanation: </strong></p>
Moreover, there are ample of documentary evidence to prove such a theory. History books tell most people that the first draft of the retraction was sent by Archbishop Bernardino Nozaleda to Rizal’s cell in Fort Santiago the night before his execution in Bagumbayan. But Rizal was said to have rejected the draft because it was lengthy.

At the end of the day, the controversy whether the National Hero actually wrote a retraction document only lies in the judgment of its reader, as no amount of proof can probably make the two opposing groups—the Masonic Rizalists (who firmly believe that Rizal did not withdraw) and the Catholic Rizalists (who were convinced Rizal retracted)—agree with each other.<p></p><p>para sa karagdagang impormasyon, suriin ang mga link na ito:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/1749436</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/2396260</p><p>#LetsStudy
