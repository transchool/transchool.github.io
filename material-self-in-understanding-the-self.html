                                            Paul Churchland and Patricia Church Paul Churchland and Patricia Churchland, who are both neuroscientists, introduced eliminate materialism-"a radical claim that ordinary, common sense understanding of the mind is deeply wrong and that some or all of the mental states posited by common sense do not actually exist" (Ramsey, 2013). For them, it is false to daim that folk psychology, or common sense psychology, is the capacity to explain mental states of people. Most of people think that we have a stream of consciousness that contains images and conceptions of things about which we have beliefs and attitudes. Our beliefs and attitudes. Our beliefs and attitudes are supported by our feelings, which include mental states like joy and sorrow, or anxiety and relief. It is also a folk belief that our sense of the world and of ourselves is a direct representation of how the world is formed, thus making our bodies reflect or adapt the way the world is (Weed, 2011). The Churchlands argued that talk of mental states would eventually be abandoned in favor of a radically different view of how the brain works not identified with mental states. For them, self is nothing else but brain, or simply, the self is contained entirely within the physical brain. In Patricia Churchland's book Touching a Nerve: The Self as Brain (2013), she wrote: "My brain and I are inseparable. I am who I am because my brain is what it is. Even so, I often think about my brain in terms different from those I use when thinking about myself. I think about my brain as that, and about myself as me. I think about my brain as having neurons, but I think of me as having a memory. Still, I know that my memory is all about the neurons in my brain. Lately, I think about my brains in more intimate terms-as me." This supports the idea that to understand the self, one must study the brain, not just the mind.

                            10. How does the interaction of your social self and material self help you understand yourself better?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>We have learned so far, among other things, that people generally want to regard themselves favourably and that they have complex, well-developed self-concepts. Of course, these more mental and emotional sides of ourselves do not develop in a vacuum. They are greatly impacted by the social factors in our environment. Some of these influences have already been hinted at; for instance, in our analysis of the self-verification hypothesis, we observed how feedback from others might impact our perceptions of ourselves and our self-worth. We also considered the ways in which our sociocultural upbringing may have an impact on the elements of our self-concept.</p><p></p><p>By looking at the various ways that the social environment affects our self-concept and self-esteem, we will examine these and other social components of the self in greater detail in this part. The self is not an isolated entity; for instance, we do not perceive ourselves as shy, jazz fans, or giving people a break at birth. Instead, our observations of and interactions with others shape these views. Do you have money or not? Is it lovely or ugly? Wise or not? Do you play video games well or poorly? How do you know that? Only by looking at others around us can we find the answers to these questions. It is true to state that the social situation is the only environment in which the ego has meaning.</p><br />

                            26. Paul Churchland and Patricia Church Paul Churchland and Patricia Churchland, who are both neuroscientists, introduced eliminate materialism-"a radical claim that ordinary, common sense understanding of the mind is deeply wrong and that some or all of the mental states posited by common sense do not actually exist" (Ramsey, 2013). For them, it is false to daim that folk psychology, or common sense psychology, is the capacity to explain mental states of people. Most of people think that we have a stream of consciousness that contains images and conceptions of things about which we have beliefs and attitudes. Our beliefs and attitudes. Our beliefs and attitudes are supported by our feelings, which include mental states like joy and sorrow, or anxiety and relief. It is also a folk belief that our sense of the world and of ourselves is a direct representation of how the world is formed, thus making our bodies reflect or adapt the way the world is (Weed, 2011). The Churchlands argued that talk of mental states would eventually be abandoned in favor of a radically different view of how the brain works not identified with mental states. For them, self is nothing else but brain, or simply, the self is contained entirely within the physical brain. In Patricia Churchland's book Touching a Nerve: The Self as Brain (2013), she wrote: "My brain and I are inseparable. I am who I am because my brain is what it is. Even so, I often think about my brain in terms different from those I use when thinking about myself. I think about my brain as that, and about myself as me. I think about my brain as having neurons, but I think of me as having a memory. Still, I know that my memory is all about the neurons in my brain. Lately, I think about my brains in more intimate terms-as me." This supports the idea that to understand the self, one must study the brain, not just the mind.
