                                            Ms. Elsie Alba is a Treasury Head in a company that operates in the amusement, gambling, and recreation industry, a licensee of Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) for bingo games. She was promoted months ago from bookkeeper to administrative assistant to the head of the treasury in the new venue located in Novaliches, Quezon City. She really enjoys her new management responsibilities and is pleased that the occupancy rate averaged 94 percent last month, way above the industry average. At times she feels stressed by the confusion of managing more than 100 employees in the venue operation of the bingo parlor, from the card issuer, disc jockey, floor manager, reservations clerk, and cashiering. She feels most at home handling the finance function, a task she always enjoyed as a trainee because she likes to make trial balance and do tasks concerning money matters. Her new assignment does not only require finance functions but also managing people in her department. One time a staff may no longer allow a player to play since the player violated the company’s policy in terms of winning. The player was then instructed for the next session, but the bingo player created trouble for not allowing to play so much so that the crowd were scared and Ms. Alba takes over direct control of the operation herself, often personally handling money matters. But sometimes while Ms. Alba is off focusing on the finance functions, other problems arise. On five days last month, clerks/card issuer at the reception area came in who appeared without having paid tickets and cards. They assumed there would be free tickets inside since one of the staff is a close friend. On one occasion, the bingo parlor ended up 35 unpaid tickets/cards. Mr. Eric Sy, the company’s general manager, is concerned about Ms. Alba's development into her new management position. He knows Ms. Alba is proud of the high occupancy levels and doesn't want to destroy that pride. However, he sees her as more interested in individual staff tasks than in the complexities of managing, training, and motivating her staff. He has talked with Ms. Alba about balancing her activities as the Head of the Treasury. Mr. Eric Sy emphasized that she needs to make sure her staff knows the systems and guidelines and be firm with employees who continue to check in clients. He plans to meet with her in a three-month performance review to see if he can shift her motivational expectations about the job. Question:1. What do you think the root cause of Ms. Alba’s problem? 2. Do her problems seem to be the result of her lack of motivational immaturity or of her lack of motivational attention to her people?

                            4. Ms. Elsie Alba is a Treasury Head in a company that operates in the amusement, gambling, and recreation industry, a licensee of Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) for bingo games. She was promoted months ago from bookkeeper to administrative assistant to the head of the treasury in the new venue located in Novaliches, Quezon City. She really enjoys her new management responsibilities and is pleased that the occupancy rate averaged 94 percent last month, way above the industry average. At times she feels stressed by the confusion of managing more than 100 employees in the venue operation of the bingo parlor, from the card issuer, disc jockey, floor manager, reservations clerk, and cashiering. She feels most at home handling the finance function, a task she always enjoyed as a trainee because she likes to make trial balance and do tasks concerning money matters. Her new assignment does not only require finance functions but also managing people in her department. One time a staff may no longer allow a player to play since the player violated the company’s policy in terms of winning. The player was then instructed for the next session, but the bingo player created trouble for not allowing to play so much so that the crowd were scared and Ms. Alba takes over direct control of the operation herself, often personally handling money matters. But sometimes while Ms. Alba is off focusing on the finance functions, other problems arise. On five days last month, clerks/card issuer at the reception area came in who appeared without having paid tickets and cards. They assumed there would be free tickets inside since one of the staff is a close friend. On one occasion, the bingo parlor ended up 35 unpaid tickets/cards. Mr. Eric Sy, the company’s general manager, is concerned about Ms. Alba's development into her new management position. He knows Ms. Alba is proud of the high occupancy levels and doesn't want to destroy that pride. However, he sees her as more interested in individual staff tasks than in the complexities of managing, training, and motivating her staff. He has talked with Ms. Alba about balancing her activities as the Head of the Treasury. Mr. Eric Sy emphasized that she needs to make sure her staff knows the systems and guidelines and be firm with employees who continue to check in clients. He plans to meet with her in a three-month performance review to see if he can shift her motivational expectations about the job. Question:1. What do you think the root cause of Ms. Alba’s problem? 2. Do her problems seem to be the result of her lack of motivational immaturity or of her lack of motivational attention to her people? Justify your answer comprehensively (50 marks) *​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Question:1. What do you think the root cause of Ms. Alba’s problem?
</p><p>Answer: The root cause of Ms. Alba’s problem was that she feels most at home handling the finance function, a task she always enjoyed as a trainee because she likes to make trial balance and do tasks concerning money matters and failed to balance her duty.
</p><p> 2. Do her problems seem to be the result of her lack of motivational immaturity or of her lack of motivational attention to her people?  </p><p>I think the problems were also a result of her lack of motivational attention to her people which is very important if your managing your employees. You must make sure that they are well acquainted with the rules and policies. You need to also monitor your people because they are your direct contact from the clients. As a manager you must make sure that your people know what they are doing. But in her situation, she only focuses on the financial aspect and solving the problems by herself.
