                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The differences of Kabuki, Wayang Kulit, and Peking Opera lie in the way they are performed, their origins, and their many key characteristics. The differences of Kabuki, Wayang Kulit, and Peking Opera are basically noted by the places they came from. Kabuki is from Japan. Wayang Kulit is founded in Indonesia. Meanwhile, Peking Opera is established in China. Aside from their origins, their characteristics also differ from one another.</p><p>2.

                            18. Can Someone Expand this one more paragraphStudents’ determination to learning focused on self-determinationtheory. Edward Deci and Richard Ryan propounded the selfdetermination theory in the middle of the 1980s. Self-determinationtheory identifies the motivational elements that trigger people’schoicesand recognises two forms of motivation: intrinsic and extrinsicmotivations (David, 2014; Neutrino, 2012). Intrinsic motivation refersto the internal motives that instigate people to actions, while extrinsicmotivation refers to task execution due to outward benefits. Self-determination in G11 students leads to organizing and planning for better educational goals. It also increases the problem-solving skills in students and causes positive things to happen in their academic life during online learning.Examples of activities used in self-determination instructional programs include reflecting on daydreams to help students decide what is important to them and teaching students how to set goals that are important to them and then, with the support of peers, family members and teachers, taking steps to achieve those goals.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Self-determination pushes a student to achieve based on intrinsic motivation rather than relying on external rewards. A self-determined student takes action based on an understanding of options and with specific goals in mind. Self-determination instruction is often used with students who have special needs and may improve success as an adult, according to the National Center on Secondary Education and Transition. Students need a supportive environment to develop self-determination skills.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
