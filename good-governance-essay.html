                                            A good thesis statement has several qualities: 1. A thesis statement is always framed as a declarative statement. Poor example: What is plagiarism? Improved version: Plagiarism can be explained from cultural and socio-political perspectives. 2. A good thesis statement is focused, meaning it provides supporting points that strengthen the main claim. Poor example: An effective local government unit should have good communication facilities and efficient re- source management programs since these initia- tives will be beneficial for its citizens. Improved version: Effective dissemination of information and effi- cient resource management are indicators of ef- fective local governance. 3. A good thesis statement has clear boundaries. It sets limits as to what the essay intends to explore. Poor example: Guitar playing skills can be improved if the player is dedicated and there are sessions devoted to technique and investments on good equipment must be considered since these will be influential in performing in front of an audience. Improved version: Excellent guitar playing requires countless hours of practice, strategic decisions in purchasing equipment, and tireless dedication.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The importance of a good government in society is  it promotes the rule of law. Good governance ensures that political, social and economic priorities are based on broad consensus in society and that the voices of the poorest and the most vulnerable are heard in decision-making over the allocation of development resources.</p><p></p><p>Governments provide the parameters for everyday behavior for citizens, protect them from outside interference, and often provide for their well-being and happiness.

                            5. A good thesis statement has several qualities: 1. A thesis statement is always framed as a declarative statement. Poor example: What is plagiarism? Improved version: Plagiarism can be explained from cultural and socio-political perspectives. 2. A good thesis statement is focused, meaning it provides supporting points that strengthen the main claim. Poor example: An effective local government unit should have good communication facilities and efficient re- source management programs since these initia- tives will be beneficial for its citizens. Improved version: Effective dissemination of information and effi- cient resource management are indicators of ef- fective local governance. 3. A good thesis statement has clear boundaries. It sets limits as to what the essay intends to explore. Poor example: Guitar playing skills can be improved if the player is dedicated and there are sessions devoted to technique and investments on good equipment must be considered since these will be influential in performing in front of an audience. Improved version: Excellent guitar playing requires countless hours of practice, strategic decisions in purchasing equipment, and tireless dedication.​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Good governance plays a critical role in shaping the overall well-being and prosperity of any society. In this essay, I will discuss the impact of good governance towards a society, focusing on key areas such as economic development, social welfare, and political stability.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, good governance promotes economic development. When the government implements policies that support economic growth, such as investing in infrastructure and education, attracting foreign investment, and providing a conducive business environment, it helps to stimulate job creation, increase productivity, and reduce poverty. This, in turn, leads to an increase in the standard of living of the people, creating a cycle of economic growth and development. In addition, good governance helps to reduce corruption, promote transparency, and ensure accountability in the use of public resources, which boosts investor confidence, leading to increased foreign investment and economic growth.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, good governance promotes social welfare. The government's role is to ensure that basic needs such as healthcare, education, and housing are met, and that vulnerable populations such as the elderly, disabled, and children are protected. Good governance ensures that these needs are met by providing quality public services that are accessible to all citizens, regardless of their social or economic status. It also promotes social inclusion by reducing inequality, discrimination, and marginalization, leading to a more cohesive and peaceful society.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, good governance promotes political stability. When the government is transparent, accountable, and responsive to the needs of its citizens, it builds trust between the government and the people. This, in turn, reduces political tensions, social unrest, and conflict, promoting a stable and peaceful environment that is conducive to economic and social development. Good governance also promotes the rule of law, protecting citizens from abuse of power, and ensuring that everyone is treated fairly and justly.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, good governance plays a crucial role in shaping the overall well-being of a society. It promotes economic development, social welfare, and political stability, creating a more prosperous, inclusive, and harmonious society. Therefore, it is essential for governments to prioritize good governance, and for citizens to hold their leaders accountable for implementing policies that promote good governance. </p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Answer:</p><p></p><p>A year ago, our government announced the first COVID-19 case in the country. Upon knowing the news, frustrations from fellowmen were seen as they grasp to the thought of possibilities being infected with the virus. Numerous of disposable face masks and face shields were sold, aiming for individual prevention. Also, PPEs for frontliners were abundant in supply to properly sustain the accountability of their respective duties during the time.</p><p></p><p>Health crisis continues to grow and expand, cases increases everyday, several deaths were gathered from the data, and the government and civilians were bothered by it. Things might lead to solutions, but this solution is quite unsure as of the moment.</p><p></p><p>In the present study, scientists from different countries had developed several types of vaccines to be tested in humans. Just recently, the Philippine Government hops in to purchase Russia's Sputnik vaccines with 97.6% efficacy and is a now a hot issue throughout the country. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declared signing-up within our local government units to get free Covid-19 vaccines. </p><p></p><p>Having this vaccine as the solution, we see this as our hope. Each of us have the opportunity to get vaccinated, and have the opportunity to get normal lives back, but first know the safety etiquettes before engaging to such risky decision. Be very much aware that once vaccinated, the vaccine stays in your body and might have some side effects, or no effect at all. We never know if this one's good or bad for you, so better think of it properly.</p><p></p><p>I hope it helps:&gt;&gt;</p><br />

It’s also about guiding and supporting the character of your business. You and anyone else on your governance team should ‘set the tone’. For example, you should always make decisions that uphold your company values and help to achieve your vision for your business. A good starting point is to make sure that everyone involved in overseeing your business is of good character. Good character can be summed up in three ways: doing the right thing, being honest about what you’re doing, taking responsibility for your actions and decisions. </p><p></p><p>Governance helps you to always act in the best interests of the business. More specifically, it can improve the performance of your business, help it become more stable and productive, and unlock new opportunities. It can reduce risks, and enable faster and safer growth. It can also improve reputation and foster trust. All these benefits mean your business is more likely to last in the long term.Good governance can also help you secure investment by creating formal reporting procedures that clearly lay out everything that investors need to know. An investor is more likely to invest in a credible business with a clear direction and good oversight. If they think your governance is sub-standard, they may see your business as a risky investment and ask for higher returns or a larger share.</p><p></p><p>Having other people involved in supervising your business can help you through tough times. Evidence of good governance has massive value when it comes to raising money or selling your business. It demonstrates to investors or buyers that the business is well run and that it’s ‘clean’.</p><br />
