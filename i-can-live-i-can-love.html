"Honestly"
by Harem Scarem
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive
You don't have to say it, I don't have to read your mind
To know that emptiness has finally arrived
How was I to know right from wrong
Words were hardly spoken, so where did I go wrong
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Words have more meaning, if they're said at certain times
I need you now so I can feel alive
How would you know if you won't give me some time
To see if everything could work out you'll be mine
I'll be lost forever or someday I may find
The words that I've been searching for or just some peace of mind
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
All the nights I sit and wonder there must be more to life
I'm sure that days and years go by while
I am living with a living with a lonely feeling
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>All animals and plants need a place to live. Most choose—or are born into—particular habitats. Habitats are places in nature that provide food, protection from predators and unfavorable weather, and a home in which to raise young.</p><p></p><p>Habitats are characterized most often by climate and location. They can range from warm, moist areas near the Equator—such as the Amazon rain forest—to cold polar areas such as the Arctic.</p><p></p><p>The animals and plants that live in a particular habitat have adaptations that allow them to survive there. For example, spider monkeys—which live in the trees of some tropical forests—have flexible tails that allow them to grasp and balance along branches. And a cactus that grows in the desert has spines that help collect and retain moisture.</p><p></p><p>Some animals build homes in their habitat. Beavers use wood and mud to construct lodges; some toads dig burrows. Other animals don’t have to do such work. They find their homes in natural places such as caves and trees</p><p></p><br />

"Honestly"
by Harem Scarem
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive
You don't have to say it, I don't have to read your mind
To know that emptiness has finally arrived
How was I to know right from wrong
Words were hardly spoken, so where did I go wrong
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Words have more meaning, if they're said at certain times
I need you now so I can feel alive
How would you know if you won't give me some time
To see if everything could work out you'll be mine
I'll be lost forever or someday I may find
The words that I've been searching for or just some peace of mind
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
All the nights I sit and wonder there must be more to life
I'm sure that days and years go by while
I am living with a living with a lonely feeling
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive</h2><br />
