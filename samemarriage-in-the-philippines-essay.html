                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Philippines Independence Day</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The Philippines, consisting of more than 7,000 separate islands in the western Pacific, declared independence from Spanish rule over 120 years ago.  Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo was responsible for making this claim but it wasn’t until 1962 that then-President Diosdado Macapagal made it a public holiday through a presidential proclamation.  The Filipino flag was unfurled for the first time on this day June 12 in 1898 at an inspiring celebration, which also featured the first public playing of the Philippines national anthem. The nation has made great strides. It’s considered to be an emerging market and a newly industrialized country. Tourism also makes a large impact on the Philippines economy.</p><p>For over 300 years, the Philippines was a Spanish colony, and is named after King Philip II of Spain. In 1521, Ferdinand Magellan landed on the Philippines islands and claimed it for Spain. Magellan wanted all the local chiefs to submit to the Spanish rule but one of them named Lapu Lapu refused. An attempt was made by Magellan to crush Lapu Lapu, but he failed and was killed.</p><p>Under the leadership of Americans, the Philippines was made a commonwealth, and semi-independent in 1935. Literacy rate also increased as many American teachers were sent to the Philippines. The USA promised that the Philippines would become completely independent in 1945.</p><p></p><p>On December 10, 1941, Japan invaded the Philippines, and captured Manila. All of the Philippines was now in the hands of the Japanese. In October, 1944, American troops returned to the Philippines and recaptured Manila. The Philippines became independent on 4 July 1946. Manuel Roxas was the first president of the newly independent nation.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><strong>The current population in the Philippines is about 110 million people. The annual population growth rate has decreased significantly since 1960 where it was 3.3% to now where it is about 1.3%. ... With about 2 million people added to the population every year, the population is expected to double in about 40 years.</strong><p></p><strong>Poverty is believed to be the leading cause of overpopulation. A lack of educational resources, coupled with high death rates leading to higher birth rates, result in impoverished areas seeing large booms in population.</strong><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p>Population Explosion In The Philippines<p></p><p>           <strong> • The Philippines belong to the group of these "less developed countries." And as we all know, the growth of population in our country is unstoppable. In fact, the Philippine population is one of the fastest growing countries in the world. It is estimated that 3,000 Filipino babies are born every day, 100,000 every month, or one million a year to round up the figures. There are more babies being born today than there were in the 1970s. There will be more babies born 20 years from now than the number of babies that are born this day. In this lies the problem: at first, the babies need milk, diapers and vitamins. But the trouble is, babies grow up. And when they do, they need education, which requires more school structures; they need food, clothing, houses, jobs, etc. These are basic needs that must be filled. Providing them creates a large number of problems that demand the fullest utilization of the nation's resources.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>#</strong><strong>C</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>Y</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>G</strong></p><br />

It can lead to other problems like poor literacy, unemployment, malnutrition, etc. A poor person is not able to get education due to lack of money and therefore remains unemployed. An unemployed person is not able to buy enough &amp; nutritious food for his family and their health decline. A weak person lacks the energy required for the job. A  jobless person remains poor only. Thus we can say that poverty is the root cause of other problems.</p><p></p><p>Having poverty is unfair, unethical, and dangerous. The Philippines should abolish poverty because its people deserve to be free of it. Poverty in the Philippines is one of the most serious problems that the government must deal with. In relation to its nature, poverty in the Philippines arose from the rapid population growth in the country. The effects of it are very visible in nature. Poverty causes many Filipinos to not pursue their education. Others seem to be contented of their lives as poor. Many parents cannot afford to send their children to school because, of the financial problem.</p><p></p><p>More Having poverty is unfair, unethical, and dangerous.

                            10. divorce in the philippines essay​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Divorce in the Philippines has been an issue for several years. in fact, the Philippines is the only country in the world besides the Vatican that does not allow divorce, mostly due to religion (de Leon, 2014). Little do people know that GABRIELA Women’s Party has already proposed House Bill No. 1799 or the Divorce Bill. If signed, this bill would allow individuals to be free of their unhappy and most of the time abusive marriages and also gives guidelines for settling financial concerns as well as the custody of the children, if any. But even though people should have the right to leave a bad marriage, divorce should not be legalized in the Philippines.</p><p></p><p>First and foremost, what exactly is divorce and why do couples do it? Oxford Dictionaries (2015) defines divorce as “the legal dissolution of marriage by a court or other competent body”. In this, many factors can be blamed like a lack of commitment and equality in the relationship, infidelity, marrying too young, and abuse (Utah State University, 2015). But what it all really boils down to is an unhappy marriage and that is what divorce should be able to fix, if ever it would be allowed. If a person is stuck in a sad, or worse, abusive marriage, then he/she should have the right to escape it. Based on the National Demographic and Health Survey conducted by the National Statistics Office, one out of five women aged 15-49 has experienced physical violence and 14.4 percent of married women have experienced physical abuse from their husbands. Statistics have also shown that wife battery ranked highest among cases of violence against women at 72 percent in 2009, affecting more than 6,000 women (Umil, 2011). On the other hand, a sad marriage is just as bad as an abusive one. According to the Philippine’s Solicitor General’s office, there were 9,117 petitions for annulment filed in 2010, 61 percent of which were filed by women. The pros of divorce definitely have good points, but the Philippine society, with its traditional mindset, is not quite ready for it.</p><p></p><p>The biggest factor as to why the Philippines should reject divorce is religion. Roughly 83 percent of Filipinos are Roman Catholics (de Leon, 2014). This means that the church’s opinion matters a lot to the people, and the church firmly says no. Firstly, marriage is one of the Seven Sacraments that all Catholics celebrate and hold dear.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Filipinos always complain about the corruption in the Philippines. Do you really think the corruption is the problem of the Philippines? I do not think so. I strongly believe that the problem is the lack of love for the Philippines.</p><p></p><p>Let me first talk about my country, Korea. It might help you understand my point. After the Korean War, South Korea was one of the poorest countries in the world. Koreans had to start from scratch because entire country was destroyed after the Korean War, and we had no natural resources.</p><p></p><p>Koreans used to talk about the Philippines, for Filipinos were very rich in Asia. We envy Filipinos. Koreans really wanted to be well off like Filipinos. Many Koreans died of famine. My father &amp; brother also died because of famine. Korean government was very corrupt and is still very corrupt beyond your imagination, but Korea was able to develop dramatically because Koreans really did their best for the common good with their heart burning with patriotism.</p><p></p><p>Koreans did not work just for themselves but also for their neighborhood and country. Education inspired young men with the spirit of patriotism. 40 years ago, President Park took over the government to reform Korea . He tried to borrow money from other countries, but it was not possible to get a loan and attract a foreign investment because the economic situation of South Korea was so bad. Korea had only three factories. So, President Park sent many mine workers and nurses to Germany so that they could send money to Korea to build a factory. They had to go through horrible experience.</p><p></p><p>In 1964, President Park visited Germany to borrow money. Hundred of Koreans in Germany came to the airport to welcome him and cried there as they saw the President Park . They asked to him, 'President, when can we be well off?' That was the only question everyone asked to him. President Park cried with them and promised them that Korea would be well off</p><p>if everyone works hard for Korea, and the President of Germany got the strong impression on them and lent money to Korea. So, President Park was able to build many factories in Korea. He always asked Koreans to love their country from their heart.</p><p></p><p>Many Korean scientists and engineers in the USA came back to Korea to help developing country because they wanted their country to be well off. Though they received very small salary, they did their best for Korea . They always hoped that their children would live in well off country. My parents always brought me to the places where poor and physically handicapped people live. They wanted me to understand their life and help them. I also worked for Catholic Church when I was in the army. The only thing I learned from Catholic Church was that we have to love our neighborhood. And, I have loved my neighborhood.</p><p></p><p>Have you cried for the Philippines? I have cried for my country several times. I also cried for the Philippines because of so many poor people. I have been to the New Bilibid prison. What made me sad in the prison were the prisoners who do not have any love for their country. They go to mass and work for Church. They pray everyday. However, they do not love the Philippines. I talked to two prisoners at the maximum-security compound, and both of them said that they would leave the Philippines right after they are released from the prison. They said that they would start a new life in other countries and never come back to the Philippines.</p><p></p><p>Many Koreans have a great love for Korea so that we were able to share our wealth with our neighborhood. The owners of factory and company were distributed their profit to their employees fairly so that employees could buy what they needed and saved money for the future and their children.</p><p></p><p>When I was in Korea, I had a very strong faith and wanted to be a priest. However, when I came to the Philippines, I completely lost my faith. I was very confused when I saw many unbelievable situations in the Philippines. Street kids always make me sad, and I see them everyday. The Philippines is the only Catholic country in Asia, but there are too many poor people here. People go to church every Sunday to pray, but nothing has been changed.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Katropa</p><p></p><p>Online</p><p></p><p>Platinum Boarder</p><p></p><p>￼</p><p></p><p>Posts: 5883</p><p></p><p>Thanks: 188</p><p></p><p>yan ang nawawala sa atin ang pagmamahal sa bayan, kaya sabi ni gordon CHANGE IN MEN” “WALANG TAMAD, WALANG TANGA. kasi ito ung nagpapalubog sa pilipinas kaya dapat nating iboto si Gordon/Bayani at turuan natin ang sarili nating magbago.</p><p></p><p>Please Log in or Create an account to join the conversation.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Essay Example - The Philippines as a Developing CountryA country is classified as part of developing countries when they fall under a high rate of population growth, low per capita income, primary sector dependence, high unemployment rates, and dependency on exports of primary commodities. That being said, most countries listed as developing countries belong to Asia, such as China, South Korea, Taiwan, India, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, and Malaysia.Even if they are on their way to growth, developing countries face more challenges along the way. The most difficult are decreasing poverty rates, access to quality education, and a good healthcare system for all its citizens. Third-world countries, especially those in Southeast Asia, are experiencing these challenges. One of them is the Philippines. The roots of the problems in the Philippines economy can be traced back to World War II, when soldiers from Japan occupied the country. The Philippines' worst inflation was then recorded in history.The Philippines struggled again with its economic growth in recent years during the Marcos era of Martial Law due, stemming from the negative image attached to the country. Marcos aimed to lead the country for consecutive terms and use the country's resources following his agenda. Oppositions against the administration then rose. This included Benigno Aquino Jr, a Filipino journalist, and politician who was assassinated right as he landed at Manila International Airport (now named Ninoy Aquino International Airport or NAIA). His death ignited the distrust of its citizens to its government. The Philippines' debt in the world bank increased from $600 million to $26 billion during the Marcos regime. The debt has caused macroeconomic effects in the Philippines, with the country continuing to pay for this debt using the current national income and remittances. At present, the Philippines is continuously facing a high population rate and low gross domestic product (GDP). Millions of Filipinos are still suffering from poverty and struggling with exporting their products up where inflow is greater than outflow of commodities within the country. <p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><strong>paki</strong><strong> </strong><strong>brainliest</strong><br />

Spain lost, and so they had to hand over the Philippine islands to the United States, who then took their place as overseers for the next fifty years.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Colonization in Philippine Philippine was one of the Southeast-Asian countries that was under the colonization of a great imperial ruler. However, unlike other countries in this region like Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia, Philippine was under the power of two big nations; Spain and America. Spain has ruled over Philippine for a very long time. Their first expedition started on March 16, 1521 when Ferdinand Magellan arrived in Cebu and claimed the island for Spain. But it did not continue for long because shortly after, Magellan was killed by a native who was against the foreign dominance. After several decades, another expedition led by Ruy López de Villalobos was sent in 1542 and eventually they gave the island the name Las Islas Filipinas</p><p></p><br />
