                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My Purpose Of Life</p><p></p><p>I heard the age-old question about the purpose of life because I’ve heard it so much. However, the first time that I really took time to think about this question was a few weeks ago. I recall waking up in the morning and asking myself a simple question, “What am I looking forward to today?” To my surprise, I couldn’t answer the question and I realized that I was currently living an extremely boring and meaningless life. I then stumbled upon another question, “What is the purpose of my life and what am I going to do in the future?” I went through my day as normal and took note on what made me feel like I had purpose; the things that made me feel purpose were the things that I enjoyed and the things…</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>For my opinion my purpose in life is to give light to other people. In a world where everything seems to be hard and cruel I want to give light to those people who's life are full of darkness. I want to give light to their lives by introducing God who guides and helps us when we are in our lowest and miserable part of our lives. By giving light to others i know that i have a purpose in this lifetime. </p><br />

1.This second trimester, you have added a lot of tek-bok writing to the entirety of your SHS study that you personally created for the Filipino Writing in Selected Fields course. It is now time to view or analyze your writings and evaluate yourself as a writer. Perform the following tasks (two parts) as part of your Expected Performance No.1 (P. T. # 1).
A. Part One: Choose THREE of your written essays in the Writing Filipino in Selected Fields (Tek-Bok) course that you would like to reflect on your writing experience. You need to compose a paragraph outlining your reflection on each of the writings you choose (because you need to choose three so in total there are three paragraphs). You can use and base the following questions to get ideas about the reflection you are going to write. However, each reflection must be in the form of a paragraph with a main idea. Make or write your reflection with an impact on the reader and not just answer the questions.
Why did you choose to write this?
What do you see as your strengths as a writer in this writing?
What important thing for you did you see when you wrote this article?
In what areas or parts of the writing did you have difficulty writing this essay?
If you were to further develop the writing of this essay, what would you do? Why?
 B. Part Two: Answering questions related to the topic: “Who Am I As A Writer?”. Answer the following questions as a reflection of your being a writer.
 1. Of the THREE writings you have chosen for your presented reflection or reflection on your writing experience, which one for you is your best work? Why?
 2. After looking at or evaluating your THREE writing choices, what do you see as your main strengths as a writer? Why?
 3. What do you think readers will learn about you (in dreams or purpose in life / in dealing with problems / in developing skills / in your personality or behavior / in expressing experiences, feelings, opinions , or outlook on life) from your tek-bok writing creations?

In what way can we deal with scarcity efficiently?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.The production possibilities curve is bowed in shape because of the law of increasing opportunity cost, which explains the idea that the more units of a product are produced, the less capability the economy has of producing other products.</p><p>2.n business analysis, the production possibility frontier (PPF) is a curve illustrating the varying amounts of two products that can be produced when both depend on the same finite resources.

PPF also plays a crucial role in economics. It can be used to demonstrate the point that any nation's economy reaches its greatest level of efficiency when it produces only what it is best qualified to produce and trades with other nations for the rest of what it needs.</p><p>4.Scarcity is one of the key concepts of economics. It means that the demand for a good or service is greater than the availability of the good or service. Therefore, scarcity can limit the choices available to the consumers who ultimately make up the economy.</p><p>5.f we only had more resources we could produce more goods and services and satisfy more of our wants. This will reduce scarcity and give us more satisfaction (more good and services). All societies therefore try to achieve economic growth. A second way for a society to handle scarcity is to reduce its wants.</p><p><strong>Explanation: sana po makatulong:(</strong></p><p></p><br />
