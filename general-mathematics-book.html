• Statistics is the process of keeping organized with and making
sense of the unlimited data encountered in everyday life. Thus, it
finds applications in many fields of human activity.
• The statistical process involves the collection, organization and
presentation, analysis, and interpretation of raw data. In general,
this process may be divided into descriptive or inferential statistics.
• Success in the study of statistics entails familiarizing and fully
understanding the key concepts associated with it.
• Data should always be transmitted, processed, and converted into
usable forms.

• Statistics is the process of keeping organized with and making
sense of the unlimited data encountered in everyday life. Thus, it
finds applications in many fields of human activity.
• The statistical process involves the collection, organization and
presentation, analysis, and interpretation of raw data. In general,
this process may be divided into descriptive or inferential statistics.
• Success in the study of statistics entails familiarizing and fully
understanding the key concepts associated with it.
• Data should always be transmitted, processed, and converted into
usable forms.

You will note a strong scientific or mathematical look and feel to the creations of many digital artists. 2. Geometric forms and repeating patterns appear frequently. 3. Traditional subjects like human beings, landscapes, animals, and still life elements are simply incorporated as part of those forms and patterns-rather than as the main focus. 4. The initial reaction of the public to computer-generated art was understandable. 5. There were questions as to whether it was, in fact, "true art" since it made use of electronic and mechanical devices, rather than the artist's own hand, to produce the images and effects. 6. Within a few years, there was a general acceptance of digital art as an exciting and thought-provoking form of modern art. 7.
