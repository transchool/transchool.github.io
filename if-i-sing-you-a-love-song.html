-THE FREE BIRD AND THE CAGE BIRD 
The tame bird was in a cage; the free bird was in the forest.
They met when the time came, it was a decree of fate.
The free bird cries, 'O my love, let us fly to the wood.'
The cage bird whispers, 'Come hither, let us both live in the cage.'
Says the free bird, 'Among bars, where is there room to spread one's wings?'
'Alas,' cries the caged bird, 'I should not know where to sit perched in the sky.'
The free bird cries, 'My darling, sing the songs of the woodlands.'
The cage bird sings, 'Sit by my side, I'll teach you the speech of the learned.'
The forest bird cries, 'No, ah no! songs can never be taught.'
The cage bird says, 'Alas for me, I know not the songs of the woodlands.'
There love is intense with longing, but they never can fly wing to wing.
Through the bars of the cage they look, and vain is their wish to know each
other.

I shall not see the shadows, I shall not feel the rain; I shall not hear the nightingale Sing on, as if in pain: And dreaming through the twilight That doth not rise nor set, Haply I may remember, And haply may forget. 1.How do Filipinos usually respond to the death of a loved one?

That someday when all will stand before us
Singing one song together
Everywhere singing
We are gonna love you, people of the wirld
We are gonna make you a better world
We will all respect you, people of the world

                                            I am a Filipino and I love who I am. 
I eat rice with fish, vegetables, or meat; bread dipped in black coffee or coffee on rice. Meat drowned in coconut milk and made spicy with siling labuyo. 
My fellow Filipinos and I, we just love to eat. 
I dance to the rhythm of gongs, drums, and other native instruments. 
I sing love songs and lullabies. 
I sing my people’s story of sacrifice and victory. 
I can live along the river or by the sea;on mountains,valleys, and hills. 
I can also navigate my way in the city amidst tall buildings, bridges, and highways. 
My color is brown. Some of us are a little bit lighter, whiter, or darker;nevertheless we are fullblooded Filipinos. Tall, short, slim, or round, my heart faithfully beats for my homeland. 
Come to my place and I will treat you like a king or a queen. 
Meet my elders whom I address with “po” and “opo”. 
When others are in need, I will be quick to come and lead a helping hand; we call this bayanihan. 
We smile a lot. Laugh at ourselves, even at our problems, challenges, and tragedies. 
Smilling and laughing means we can rise above whatever may come to us. 
Perhaps that is because we pray a lot, we have a lot of churches, and we are not afraid to show we believe in God Almighty. 
I am a Filipino, I love my country, I love my people, my culture, and traditions. 
I am a Filipino and I love who I am.

-THE FREE BIRD AND THE CAGE BIRD 
The tame bird was in a cage; the free bird was in the forest.
They met when the time came, it was a decree of fate.
The free bird cries, 'O my love, let us fly to the wood.'
The cage bird whispers, 'Come hither, let us both live in the cage.'
Says the free bird, 'Among bars, where is there room to spread one's wings?'
'Alas,' cries the caged bird, 'I should not know where to sit perched in the sky.'
The free bird cries, 'My darling, sing the songs of the woodlands.'
The cage bird sings, 'Sit by my side, I'll teach you the speech of the learned.'
The forest bird cries, 'No, ah no! songs can never be taught.'
The cage bird says, 'Alas for me, I know not the songs of the woodlands.'
There love is intense with longing, but they never can fly wing to wing.
Through the bars of the cage they look, and vain is their wish to know each
other.
They flutter their wings in yearning, and sing, 'Come closer, my love!'
The free bird cries, 'It cannot be, I fear the closed doors of the cage.'
The cage bird whispers, 'Alas, my wings are powerless and dead.</h2><br />

                            28. I am a Filipino and I love who I am. 
I eat rice with fish, vegetables, or meat; bread dipped in black coffee or coffee on rice. Meat drowned in coconut milk and made spicy with siling labuyo. 
My fellow Filipinos and I, we just love to eat. 
I dance to the rhythm of gongs, drums, and other native instruments. 
I sing love songs and lullabies. 
I sing my people’s story of sacrifice and victory. 
I can live along the river or by the sea;on mountains,valleys, and hills. 
I can also navigate my way in the city amidst tall buildings, bridges, and highways. 
My color is brown. Some of us are a little bit lighter, whiter, or darker;nevertheless we are fullblooded Filipinos. Tall, short, slim, or round, my heart faithfully beats for my homeland. 
Come to my place and I will treat you like a king or a queen. 
Meet my elders whom I address with “po” and “opo”. 
When others are in need, I will be quick to come and lead a helping hand; we call this bayanihan. 
We smile a lot. Laugh at ourselves, even at our problems, challenges, and tragedies. 
Smilling and laughing means we can rise above whatever may come to us. 
Perhaps that is because we pray a lot, we have a lot of churches, and we are not afraid to show we believe in God Almighty. 
I am a Filipino, I love my country, I love my people, my culture, and traditions. 
I am a Filipino and I love who I am.
