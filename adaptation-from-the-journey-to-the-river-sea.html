                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Maia has problems not with Brazil but with the family she with whom she is staying.
Gwendolyn and Beatrice are selfish little brats.
Maia leans to be resolute about the things she wants as what her friends, Finn and Clovis did.
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>While Maia finds the mystique of Brazil interesting, <strong>she couldn’t bear the enigmatic attitude of her distant relatives, the Carters who look down at the natives and would complain about everything in Brazil</strong>. As a result, they hardly go out and would often express hate about the place they live in which means Maia must also stay indoors.
The sisters, <strong>Gwendolyn and Beatrice</strong>, Maia’s cousins, <strong>seem to have imbibed the attitude of their parents towards Brazil</strong>. They would also fight even about the littlest of things.
Maia’s two friends, <strong>Clovis and Finn have shown her that one can do what he/she resolves to do if he/she sets sights to it</strong>. They were able to pursue what they want to do with Clovis returning to England disguised as Finn, the rich heir, so he can go back to his foster mother while Finn who used Clovis’ identity has been free to roam Brazil in search of his mother’s tribe, the Xanti.<p></p><p>#BRAINLYEVERYDAY</p><br />

                            26. character description of Sir Aubrey in the book journey to the river sea</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The book opens in an exclusive London girls' school, The Mayfair Academy for Young Ladies. Maia, an orphan, is sent from this safe and cosy environment to stay with distant relations, the Carters, who are not as kind as she had hoped for. The Carters do not embrace their surroundings and almost always stay indoors, except for trips to Manaus. Beatrice and Gwendolyn, the twin daughters, are selfish and seem to be brought up strictly to be British, while their father, the eccentric Mr Carter, obsessively collects the glass eyes of famous people. Living with the family is Miss Minton, governess to Maia and the twins, who, despite an outwardly strict appearance, begins to care deeply for Maia.</p><p>The family plans to see a play starring Clovis King, an English child actor, but the twins lie and say that all the tickets had sold out so they couldn't buy one for Maia. She decides to go anyway and secretly slips out of the Carters house to get there. When she gets lost, a Native boy takes her to the theatre on his boat. When Maia finally gets to watch Little Lord Fauntleroy, Clovis acts very well, but during the pivotal scene, his voice cracks and the play is ruined.</p><p>Later, Maia meets an orphaned half Xanti, half British boy called Finn Taverner and finds out that he was the boy who gave her a ride to Clovis's act. Two detectives, Mr. Trapwood and Mr. Low, whom Maia nicknames "the crows", are chasing him because his grandfather, Lord Aubrey Taverner, wants to find the heir of Westwood, the estate of the wealthy Taverner family. Finn doesn't want to go because of the terrible memories his father had of living in Westwood, and because he wants to travel up the Amazon to where the Xanti, the Native tribe to which his mother belonged, live. Afterward, Clovis meets Finn too and Finn suggests that they swap positions by making Clovis take the place of Finn. Clovis, also an orphan, desperately wants to go back to England, while Finn wants to stay in Brazil. Clovis will pretend to be Finn Taverner and become the heir to Westwood, while Finn will explore the "River Sea" (the name given to the Amazon River by locals).</p><p>The swapping is successful, and for a while, everything seems to be going fairly well. But then one day, Miss Minton disappears. She has plans to rescue Maia from the Carters by taking the place of Mademoiselle Lille, the governess to a Russian family, the Kaminsky's, Maia's friends Sergei and Olga and their parents, the Count and Countess Kaminsky. However, Maia, who Miss Minton eventually plans to take with her, does not know this and believes that she has been abandoned. While she is gone, the twins accidentally start a fire in the Carters' home. Mrs. Carter, distracted by Beatrice and Gwendolyn's fighting, accidentally spills insect repellent onto the oil lamp, burning the twins' bedroom and finally the whole house. The Carters are sent to the hospital in the river ambulance, but Maia is left on her own. She is found by Finn and he takes her on his boat, the Arabella, to embark on the adventure she had hoped for.</p><p>Miss Minton and her friend, Professor Neville Glastonberry, chase after them by boat as well. They find the Xanti and for a short time, they live with them and are perfectly happy. One day, Maia is singing for the Xanti when the police from Manaus hear her voice and also find Miss Minton's corset, and, thinking they are rescuing Miss Minton, Maia, and the curator of the Natural History Museum, take them back to Manaus.</p><p>Meanwhile, in England, Clovis confesses that he is not the heir and wishes to go home, which causes Sir Aubrey to have a heart attack. Finn goes to Westwood to help Clovis, but Clovis tells him that he has since told Sir Aubrey that his confession was simply a joke. Finn is relieved as this means he can return to Brazil.</p><p>In the end, Mrs. Carter, Beatrice, and Gwendolyn return to England to become servants of their wealthy relative, Lady Parsons. Maia, Miss Minton, and Finn all return to Manaus and Clovis, under the assumed identity of Finn, is able to stay in England and becomes the heir to Westwood.</p><p></p><p>Sana naka tulong</p><br />
