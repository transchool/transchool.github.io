                                            MYCENAEAN CULTURE The Mycenaean civilization was rich and progressive. This is proven by their masks, ornaments, and weapons made of gold. The tombs of kings contain gold and beautiful pots. Their palaces were large and formidable. They had a system of writing. It was discovered by Sir Arthur Evans which he called Linear B. The Mycenaeans had a belief in an all-powerful god called Zeus who reigned over a family of gods and goddesses. A few years after the end of the 13th century B.C.E., Mycenaean civilization declined in power. The most probable reason was the widespread fighting among the Mycenaeans. your Performance Tasks​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>A COMPASSIONATE HEART</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Empathy is characterized as a sensation of profound <strong>compassion</strong> toward another who is blasted by adversity, joined by a powerful urge to lighten the misery. May these statements move you to turn into a more <strong>compassion</strong>ate individual with the goal that you raise your person to a more elevated level. The idea of sympathy includes sincere association. In this we include ourselves with the insight of a more prominent will. The opportunity asserted through tuning in, learning and seeing brings mindfulness. This spot of <strong>compassion</strong> is the potential alleviating we figure out how to make. We learn of sympathy's interesting method of delicacy and of effectively cultivating poise. It is maybe a definitive vehicle for change motivating constant investigation, appreciation and amendment. Empathy is a really imposing power; it's the little towing boat equipped for directing us past what apparently seems, by all accounts, to be unmanageable. The <strong>compassion</strong> heart is a vehicle in otherworldly development. The individuals who know see, the association God and heart. ​​​To have <strong>compassion</strong> implies not exclusively to have the option to live with the other's incident yet additionally to feel with him any feeling euphoria, uneasiness, joy, torment. This sort of empathy, along these lines connotes the maximal limit of full of feeling creative mind, the specialty of passionate clairvoyance. In the chain of importance of opinions, then, at that point, it is preeminent.</p><p></p><p>What is the opposite gender of nun?:   https://brainly.ph/question/2107279</p><p></p><p>#LETSSTUDY</p><p></p><br />
