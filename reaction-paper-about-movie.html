On their walk home from the club one day around midnight, they witness the kidnapping of a girl named Yun-Jung. However, the local police station's missing persons department is occupied at the moment with the kidnapping of a son of a business tycoon and is unable to conduct an investigation. They start their rudimentary inquiry knowing that they are in the crucial hours following a kidnapping. When Ki-j;oon and H33-yeol catch up with the abductors, it turns out that the group is conducting a ring to harvest unfertilized eggs and has many more girls imprisoned at their hideout.</p><p></p><p>While trying to fr'ee them, Ki-j;oon and H33-yeol are beaten and imprisoned. The next day, after escaping their captors, they find their hiding pl4ce deserted and a chilly route. Their professor Yang Sung-il advises them not to continue investigating the matter because they are not acting police officers. They receive rigorous physical training, and with the aid of CCTV footage, they are able to locate the kidnappers in a reproductive clinic. This time, much more prepared, the pair break into the building to fr'ee the girls on their own. They are armed and armored.</p><p></p><p>All of the kidnappers, including their master Yang-choon, are defeated by them. They phone the police in an attempt to stop the kidnappers and fr'ee all the abducted females, but they are unable to do so and fear being expelled for their conduct.

                        Moana is about a girl that loves the sea. But her father, Chief Tui, wants her to stay and be the new chief of Moana's little village. Suddenly, Moana noticed that her little village is loosing its beauty. And her Grandmother, gave her the necklace before she died. And in that necklace was containing the heart of Te Fiti. Her Grandmother told her to set sail to look for Maui, Demigod of the wind and sea, by following the constellation of Maui's hook. Moana got ready for her trip, then suddenly her mother caught her, but Moana's mom helped her in preparing for the trip. Moana took the boat that Moana and her Grandmother found, and she picked the boat that has the design of Te Fiti's heart. Then she set sail, and when she was almost past the reef, she saw the hut where her Grandmother was, and the light turned off. This means that she died, then a magical looking stingray passed her boat, and Moana remembered that her grandmother wanted to be a stingray when she dies. Moana wasn't very good at sailing a boat. The waves were calm, but suddenly a storm came by and Moana has to stay strong, she asked for help from the sea, but the sea didn't respond, so her boat toppled over and she drowned. When she woke up, she found herself in an island with Hayhay which is her chicken friend that secretly borded the boat. Then Moana heard someone coming, so she hid under the toppled over boat with Hayhay. When Maui lifted the boat, he screamed to see Moana, so he accidentally dropped the boat, Maui lifted the boat up, and he couldn't see where the girl was. Then he felt a tap, then he turned around to where the tap was from, with the boat. Moana and Maui did some introductions. Then Maui trapped Moana in a cave where his statue is. Moana escaped then she didn't catch the boat, because it was already set sail. But the sea helped her in getting to the boat. Maui tried and tried to get Moana off the boat, but the sea kept washing her back on the boat. Then a antagonist came, they were like small living coconuts, and they were called Kakamora. They were after the heart, then a battle began. Some part of it was funny. Then they barely escaped from the antagonists grasp. Maui set sail to a island full of montsers, to get his fish hook back from Tamatoa. Maui taught Moana to sail a boat. Tamatoa wanted the heart too. Moana and Maui barely escaped. Now they set sail to Te Fiti, to return her heart. When they got there they saw a giant woman made of lava, her name is Te Ka. Moana and Maui fought to get to Te Fiti, but it wasn't enough. Te Ka hit Maui's fish hook with brutal  force, that it made them far away from Te Fiti, and it made the sail of the boat rip, and it made Maiu's fish hook to break. Maui left Moan on the boat. Moana thought she has no hope, until her grandmother's spirit came. The grandmother showed Moana that she can do anything, and Moana believed in it and she sewed the sail, and she set sail to Te Fiti. She found a way through without Te Ka hitting her. Maui came back to help, even if his hook is severely damaged. Moana got to the brink of the island of Te Fiti, but she didn't see her there. Moana looked at Te Ka, and she found out that Te Fiti is Te Ka! Moana let Te Ka come to her, and Moana sang a song about true selves. And Te Ka wasn't so grumpy anymore. Moana put the heart into the slot, and the ashes and rocks from Te Ka was breaking and falling. And came out the beautiful Te Fiti. Te Fiti placed herself to get ready for her enternal sleep, then she fixed Maui's fish hook and she granted Moana a new boat, for her to go home. Moana set sail home, then the flowers and plants in her village was blooming and blossoming again. Her parents went up to the beach to see Moana's safe return.

                            19. REACTION PAPER ABOUT ENCANTO MOVIE (200 WORDS)</h2><br />
                        <p>Answer:</p><p>Encanto (2021)' is, for me, easily Disney's best film of 2021. It's vibrant, colourful and energetic from its opening moments, ultimately emerging as an utterly enchanting and enjoyable experience. It's full of life and passion, balancing its cavalcade of near-neon hues and fast-paced musical cues with some genuine character development and a strong underlying theme. Of course, the flick is highly derivative of similar fare, with its set-up and ultimate payoff feeling especially well-worn even within Disney's own filmography. The thing is, though, that just because it has been done before doesn't mean it isn't worth doing again, particularly if it is done as well as it is here. The piece packs quite a bit of emotional punch and manages to truly stick its cathartic landing, presenting a message that's relevant and resonant no matter who you are. It also includes a few innovations on the formula, primarily in that it doesn't really have an actual antagonist (though you could argue that the antagonist is societal and familial pressure born from generational trauma). The final few moments come incredibly close to undermining the entire point of the plot, but the piece is just about able to have its cake and eat it, too. It does this by avoiding the most obvious way in which it could undercut its central theme, instead opting to stick to its guns when it comes to the one element that really needs to be steadfast in order for its theming not to seem hypocritical. The picture is steeped in Columbian culture, which is a treat to see, and eludes to the violent displacement that many Columbian people have sadly experienced, allowing its genuine magic to be born from genuine tragedy. It isn't exactly dark overall - in fact, it actively reduces its more grim elements to near subtext - but it has a much deeper understanding of its central themes than you may expect. The flick is just a ton of fun, too. Its animation is downright beautiful at times, and its overall aesthetic is just really magical. Its musical sequences are spectacular, both in terms of their audio and their accompanying visuals, and they do a fantastic job of advancing the story while also providing an insight into the various characters they relate to. They're also just really enjoyable. However, because of their often overly complex nature (a symptom of the way in which Lin-Manuel Miranda writes almost all of his music), I can't see myself listening to them outside of the movie. They also aren't all that memorable. Still, it's worth noting that I've only seen the feature once and that the songs may grow on me over time. It's also worth noting that almost every character feels like a richly rounded individual, afforded just enough attention so that they stand out and appear to have depth without detracting from the protagonist's internal journey. A handful of characters are given proper arcs, which are satisfying and appreciated even if some are housed entirely within a single song, and the affable hero (who seems much older than fifteen, more like a young adult) is afforded the opportunity to grow over the course of the entire affair. Her journey is one of self-actualisation, and I like how the narrative frames her development through the way she is perceived rather than the way she actually is (mild thematic spoilers to follow). She isn't 'the chosen one' or anything like that, she's simply herself and that's all she needs to be. There's never anything 'wrong' with her and she's pretty much always in the right; her journey involves both herself and her family learning to appreciate her for who she is rather than for what she can or can't do, something which ultimately applies to each member of the household (end of mild thematic spoilers). Again, this isn't groundbreaking, but it's a resonant and well-realised arc that's executed successfully enough that its culmination is actually quite affecting. Overall, this is a satisfying and entertaining animated musical. It's full of infectious energy and is just a blast pretty much from start to finish. It has a handful of plot problems I haven't touched on, but they aren't really worth mentioning because they have very little impact on the experience. It's a really enjoyable and enchanting affair that should make you smile and might make you cry.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p>I think the movie San Andreas is not possible to happen in real life well there are possibilities but the other scene is kinda not realistic but of course it is a movie.

                        I can say that the movie The Midnight sun is not just romantic but a tearjearker kind of movie. It touchies my heart that the character should make a hard decision in the things that she needs to do. The movie also makes a brilliant point to tell us that it’s important to move on and continue to embrace life.<br /><br />

na Kita kita na ipinalabas noong 201 na pinagbidahan ni Alessandra de Rosi (Lea)

ginanapan ni Alessanda bilang Lea ay nagtataglay ng magandang repleksyon ng taong

isang iglap ay nagbago ang pakikitungo nito kay Tonio at naging magkaibigan. At
di naglaon ay naging komportable at nahulog sa isa't isa. Napakasayang isipin na
hindi lahat ng tao ay di alintana at ginagawang handlang ang kapansanan at kakulangan

                        <p>"Taare Zameen Par" was a very interesting movie about Ishaan Awasthi, a child with learning disabilities. Ishaan was always misunderstood, and it seemed like no else appreciated him, including his parents, other children and teachers in their school. At school, teachers cannot understand him, thinking that he was just only crazy, lazy and disobedient. They didn’t even try to examine why the child is having difficulties in his studies. Also, other children always bullied him because they thought that he is an idiot. Even his father can't understand why Ishaan is different from his intelligent older brother. He was then sent to boarding school by his father because his academic statues did not improved, and he thought Ishaan was naughty and a lazy kid that needs discipline, but he doesn’t know that being apart from them will made the child more emotional and not wanting to communicate with other people. But when teacher Ram Shankar Nikumbh came, He notice that there’s something wrong with Ishaan.</p><br />
