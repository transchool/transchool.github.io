In high school, history subjects were focused on Asian, World and Contemporary issues of the country and even the world. Tertiary level also lessens the subjects in Rizal and Political Science subjects as a minor subject. As a Filipino and history student, is it necessary for the state to prioritize history related subjects especially in the Junior-Senior High and College studies? Is there an impact for the development of the nationhood of the Filipinos if these situations will continually happen for the coming year to come?
