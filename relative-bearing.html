                                            In the sixth month the angel ________________ was sent by God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth, to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was ________________, of the house of David. The virgin’s name was_____________. And he came to her and said, “Greetings, favored one! The Lord is with you.” But she was much _________________by his words and pondered what sort of greeting this might be. The angel said to her, “Do not be ____________________, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And now, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you will name him _________________. He will be great, and will be called the Son of the most ______________, and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his ancestor David. He will reign over the house of _________________forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.” 34 Mary said to the angel, “How can this be, since I am a __________________? The angel said to her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be holy; he will be called Son of God. And now, your relative ____________________ in her old age has also conceived a son; and this is the sixth month for her who was said to be barren. For nothing will be impossible with God. “Then Mary said, “Here am I, the servant of the Lord; let it be with me according to your word.” Then the angel departed from her.</a>

Prayer ________ (help) us to put into words exactly what __ (be) troubling us. Prayer, in a way ____ (be) very much like writing our problem down on paper. If we _____________ (ask) help for a problem -even from God- we must put it into words.
Prayer ________ (give) us a sense of sharing our burdens, of not being alone. Few of us _________ (be) so strong that we can bear our heaviest burdens, all by ourselves. Sometimes our worries _________ (be) of so intimate a nature that we __________ (do) not discuss them even with our closest relatives or friends. Then prayer __________ (be) the answer. Any psychiatrist will tell us that when we __________ (be) pent-up and tense, it _________ (be) therapeutically good to tell someone out troubles. When we can’t tell anyone else – we can always tell God.
Prayer __________ (put) into force an active principle of doing. It _________ (be) a first step toward action. A famous scientist __________ (say) that prayer _________ (be) the most powerful form of energy one can generate. So why not make use of it? Call it God or Allah or Spirit – why quarrel with definitions as long as the mysterious powers of nature ___________ (take) us in hand.</a>

                                            Years ago, you planted a mango tree and took very good care of it. In all those years, you have known every single part of that tree. Now, that mango tree is bearing fruits that are glean, pest-resistant, and sweeter than your average mango.
One day, you were invited by your relatives to come over for a week to a distant town. During that same week, your neighbor was out on a business trip. When both of you came back, you find mess all over the place, and your mango tree somehow is now in your neighbor’s yard. Both of you are dismayed and confused. You do not want to give up your tree, but it looks like your neighbor’s having an interest to this new addition. How will you explain to your neighbor that the mango tree is really yours?</a>
