                                            Joseph wants to compare the chemical properties of two substances. In doing it, he prepared two flasks containing the substances and labeled them Liquid A and Liquid B. He monitored the boiling points of the liquids and found that the boiling points were 100°C for substance A and 110°C - 112 C for liquid B. How would you classify the two liquids?

So, to distinguish which is which, they heated the two samples using an improvised melting dish. Both the two samples were heated at the same time and received an equal amount of heat.

If the initial temperature of the pellets is 25.0°C, and the initial temperature of the hot water is 90.0°C, what was the final temperature in °C?

Both substances are white crystalline powder. They cannot determine which is a substance and mixture just by looking at it. So, to distinguish which is which, they heated the two samples using an improvised melting dish. Both the two samples were heated at the same time and received an equal amount of heat. After a few minutes, they had observed that Solid A melts completely within a short period of time; while Solid B has portions that seem to be not melting. Guide Questions: 1.
