Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses causing a range of illnesses, from the common cold to more serious infections such as those caused by Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Coronavirus can also cause a variety of diseases in farm animals and domesticated pets.​</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>Three Ways of Explaining a Concept <p></p><p><strong>1. Definition </strong>- is the method of identifying a given term and making its meaning clearer. It can be presented in three ways </p><p>i. Formal – explains a term to be defined, category and details </p><p>Example: Vitamin E is a light yellow fat- soluble vitamins that acts an anti- oxidant. </p><p>ii. Informal – is done through a parenthetical or brief explanation </p><p>Example : Tocopherol ( Vitamin E ) is naturally found in vegetable oil, fish and nuts </p><p>iii. Extended – a detailed way of defining and term and usually composed of at least one paragraph ( formal and informal, comparison and contrast, narration, description , etc.) </p><p>
</p><p><strong>2. Explication</strong>- is a method of explanation in which sentences, verses, quotes or passages are taken from a literary or academic work and then interpreted and explained in a detailed way </p><p>Example: The poem titled “ The Road Not Taken” by Robert Frost is about a man reflecting on a choice he had once made. While the outcome of his choice is not implied to be positive or negative the speaker notes that the choice in itself and the consequences of that choice have made a huge difference in a way his life is unfolded.</p><p>
