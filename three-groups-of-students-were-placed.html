This study examined the relationship of book and e-book, this paper tends to identify in 1 affects reading comprehension. Three out of ten students in the Philippines are more hooked to reading materials published online. This paper's objectives aim to find the centre problem of the respondents when it comes to understanding complex material. 2. The physical "brick and mortar" classroom is starting to lose its monopoly as the place of learning. The Internet has made online learning possible, and many researchers and educators are interested in online learning to enhance and improve student learning outcomes while combating the reduction in resources, particularly in higher education. It is only three percent of the population worldwide compared to traditional face-to-face format and the factors that influence the effectiveness of online courses. This study examines the evidence of the effectiveness of online learning by organizing and summarizing the findings and challenges of online learning into positive, negative, mixed, and null findings. 3. The purpose of this study was comparing effectiveness of methods of presentation of concept maps and methods of concept mapping on reading comprehension. The subjects of this study consisted of sixty-six third-year high school students (thirty-three female, thirty-three male), that were selected randomly by multistage sampling method. Participants were randomly assigned to three treatment groups and 1 control group. The research instruments were: 1) experimental texts, 2) comprehension test, and 3) Camp Tools software, and 4) Teacher-generated concept maps. Treatment groups included computer-based concept mapping, paper-pencils concept mapping, and reading text with prepared concept maps. The control group for the study did not receive any concept map. The results of this study indicated that presentation of per-prepared concept maps significantly improved comprehension, compared to the map generation and control group. But paper- pencil and computer-based concept mapping compared to the control groups were not statistically significant. The best way for use of concept maps is teacher-generated concept maps with texts.pahelp plesss ​</a>

Answer the given questions on the text boxesThe School Uniform Question1 Individualism in a fundamental part of society in many countries. Most people believe in the right to express their own opinion without fear of punishment. This value, however, is coming under fire in an unlikely place the public school classroom. The issue is school uniforms. Should public school students be allowed to make individual decisions about clothing, or should all students be required to wear a uniform? School uniforms are the better choice for three reasons2 First, wearing school uniforms would help make students' lives simpler. They would no longer have to decide what to wear every morning, sometimes trying on outfit after outfit in an effort to choose Uniforms would not only save time but also would eliminate the stressoften associated with this chore.Second, school uniforms influence students to act responsibly in groups and as individuals. Uniforms give students the message that school is a special place for learning. In addition, uniforms create a feeling of unity among students. For example, when students do something as a group, such as attend meetings in the auditorium or eat lunch in the cafeteria, the fact that they all wear the same uniform gives them a sense of community. Even more important, statistics show the positive effects that school uniforms have on violence and truancy. According to a recent survey in a large school district in Florida, incidents of school violence dropped by 30 percent, attendance and test scores improved, and student suspensions declined approximately 30 percent after school uniforms were introducedFinally, school uniforms would help make all the students feel equal. Students' standards of living differ greatly from family to family, and some people are well-off while others are not. People sometimes forget that school is a place to get an education, not to promote a "fashion show. Implementing mandatory school uniforms would make all the students look the same regardless of their financial status. School uniforms would promote pride and help to raise the self-esteem of students who cannot afford to wear expensive clothing3HEALTHY PERSONTransmission Probabilitywithout markTransmission ProbabilityLOWTransmission Probability LOWESTwith mask1.

A group of grade 8 students were assigned to perform an activity in their Science class. They were tasked to perform an activity about the Particulate Nature of Solid, Liquid and Gas. They brought with them the materials for the said activity which were: 3 empty small boxes with cover (same size) and marbles. They followed the direction that were given to them by their teacher. The first procedure was to completely fill the first box with marbles. For the second box, they half-fill it with marbles and the third box they place 3 pieces of marbles inside. They cover the three boxes and they make sure that the marbles are sealed tightly in the box. After that they label each box Afor completely filled box with marbles, B- for half-filled box with marbles and C – for 3 pcs of marbles inside the box. After labelling the box, they shake the boxes at the same time. They listen to the sound each box produces.

Three out of ten students in the Philippines are more hooked to reading materials published online. This paper's objectives aim to find the centre problem of the respondents when it comes to understanding complex material. 2. The physical "brick and mortar" classroom is starting to lose its monopoly as the place of learning. The Internet has made online learning possible, and many researchers and educators are interested in online learning to enhance and improve student learning outcomes while combating the reduction in resources, particularly in higher education. It is only three percent of the population worldwide compared to traditional face-to-face format and the factors that influence the effectiveness of online courses. This study examines the evidence of the effectiveness of online learning by organizing and summarizing the findings and challenges of online learning into positive, negative, mixed, and null findings. 3. The purpose of this study was comparing effectiveness of methods of presentation of concept maps and methods of concept mapping on reading comprehension. The subjects of this study consisted of sixty-six third-year high school students (thirty-three female, thirty-three male), that were selected randomly by multistage sampling method. Participants were randomly assigned to three treatment groups and 1 control group. The research instruments were: 1) experimental texts, 2) comprehension test, and 3) Camp Tools software, and 4) Teacher-generated concept maps. Treatment groups included computer-based concept mapping, paper-pencils concept mapping, and reading text with prepared concept maps. The control group for the study did not receive any concept map. The results of this study indicated that presentation of per-prepared concept maps significantly improved comprehension, compared to the map generation and control group. But paper- pencil and computer-based concept mapping compared to the control groups were not statistically significant. The best way for use of concept maps is teacher-generated concept maps with texts.pahelp plesss ​</h2><br />

                            11. Learning Task 3Read the argumentative essay that follows. Answer the given questions on the text boxesThe School Uniform Question1 Individualism in a fundamental part of society in many countries. Most people believe in the right to express their own opinion without fear of punishment. This value, however, is coming under fire in an unlikely place the public school classroom. The issue is school uniforms. Should public school students be allowed to make individual decisions about clothing, or should all students be required to wear a uniform? School uniforms are the better choice for three reasons2 First, wearing school uniforms would help make students' lives simpler. They would no longer have to decide what to wear every morning, sometimes trying on outfit after outfit in an effort to choose Uniforms would not only save time but also would eliminate the stressoften associated with this chore.Second, school uniforms influence students to act responsibly in groups and as individuals. Uniforms give students the message that school is a special place for learning. In addition, uniforms create a feeling of unity among students. For example, when students do something as a group, such as attend meetings in the auditorium or eat lunch in the cafeteria, the fact that they all wear the same uniform gives them a sense of community. Even more important, statistics show the positive effects that school uniforms have on violence and truancy. According to a recent survey in a large school district in Florida, incidents of school violence dropped by 30 percent, attendance and test scores improved, and student suspensions declined approximately 30 percent after school uniforms were introducedFinally, school uniforms would help make all the students feel equal. Students' standards of living differ greatly from family to family, and some people are well-off while others are not. People sometimes forget that school is a place to get an education, not to promote a "fashion show. Implementing mandatory school uniforms would make all the students look the same regardless of their financial status. School uniforms would promote pride and help to raise the self-esteem of students who cannot afford to wear expensive clothing3HEALTHY PERSONTransmission Probabilitywithout markTransmission ProbabilityLOWTransmission Probability LOWESTwith mask1.

They brought with them the materials for the said activity which were: 3 empty small boxes with cover (same size) and marbles. They followed the direction that were given to them by their teacher. The first procedure was to completely fill the first box with marbles. For the second box, they half-fill it with marbles and the third box they place 3 pieces of marbles inside. They cover the three boxes and they make sure that the marbles are sealed tightly in the box. After that they label each box Afor completely filled box with marbles, B- for half-filled box with marbles and C – for 3 pcs of marbles inside the box. After labelling the box, they shake the boxes at the same time. They listen to the sound each box produces.
