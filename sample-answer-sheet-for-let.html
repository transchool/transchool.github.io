                        <p> Global warming is a problem that has been around for a while now, and it seems to be getting worse. The biggest cause of this problem is humans and their practices. Humans are contributing to global warming by using fossil fuels, which release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This causes temperatures to rise, which in turn causes more carbon dioxide to be released.</p><p></p><p>The biggest way we can combat this issue is by making sure that we're not releasing any more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This can be done by switching over to renewable energy sources like solar power or wind power instead of burning fossil fuels like coal or oil for energy needs. Another way we can help combat global warming is by using less electricity overall so that less energy is being used overall and less carbon dioxide being released into our atmosphere.</p><br />
