Select your own position paper title.PRO-ARGUEMENTSCOUNTER ARGUEMENTSTEP 2: Create an outlineAfter the research and collection of data to support your position, create an outline for the paper.POSITION PAPER TEMPLATEI. IntroductionA. Introduce the topicB. Provide background on the topic to explain why it is importantC. Assert the thesis (your view of the issue). More on thesis statements can be found below.Your introduction has a dual purpose: to indicate both the topic and your approach to it (your thesis statement), and to arouse your reader’s interest in what you have to say. One effective way of introducing a topic is to place it in context – to supply a kind of backdrop that will put it in perspective. You should discuss the area into which your topic fits, and then gradually lead into your specific field of discussion (re: your thesis statement).II. Counter ArgumentA. Summarize the counterclaimsB. Provide supporting information for counterclaimsC. Refute the counterclaimsD. Give evidence for argumentYou can generate counterarguments by asking yourself what someone who disagrees with you might say about each of the points you've made or about your position as a whole. Once you have thought up some counterarguments, consider how you will respond to them--will you concede that your opponent has a point but explain why your audience should nonetheless accept your argument? Will you reject the counterargument and explain why it is mistaken? Either way, you will want to leave your reader with a sense that your argument is stronger than opposing arguments.When you are summarizing opposing arguments, be charitable. Present each argument fairly and objectively, rather than trying to make it look foolish. You want to show that you have seriously considered the many sides of the issue, and that you are not simply attacking or mocking your opponents.It is usually better to consider one or two serious counterarguments in some depth, rather than to give a long but superficial list of many different counterarguments and replies.Be sure that your reply is consistent with your original argument. If considering a counterargument changes your position, you will need to go back and revise your original argument accordingly.III. Your ArgumentA. Assert point #1 of your claims1. Give your educated and informed opinion2. Provide support/proof using more than one source (preferably three)B. Assert point #2 of your claims1. Give your educated and informed opinion2. Provide support/proof using more than one source (preferably three)C. Assert point #3 of your claims1. Give your educated and informed opinion2. Provide support/proof using more than one source (preferably three)You may have more than 3 overall points to your argument, but you should not have fewer.IV. ConclusionA. Restate your argumentB. Provide a plan of action but do not introduce new informationSTEP 3. Write a draft of your paperCreate a draft of your position paper by following the outline and filling it in with research and content. Remember to use appeals to the readers' logic, emotions and ethics when writing an argument because these are powerful methods of persuasion. Ensure that there is substantial evidence supporting your position and consider conducting more research if you feel it could improve the paper.Report pag nonsense ang sagot!!​</a>

                                            Should Homework be Mandatory? I can almost see many students nodding along with me as I ask this question. Younger generations overloaded with home tasks and numerous assignments have already raised this issue many times.  Yet, homework remains mandatory. Is it fair or should it be cancelled?  I believe that homework should not be viewed as a mandatory part of education for several reasons.  First, children spend seven hours every single workday at school. That is a huge chunk of life, and with homework added on top of these hours, a child is left with no time to live his life to the fullest, socialize, or grow in other areas. Second, sitting at your desk solving problems does no good to your health. Kids need time to get outside and have some fun, join a football league, or ride their bikes with friends around the block. Otherwise, children will be very smart but  surprisingly weak physically. Another argument against this position is that homework is not always the best way to obtain knowledge quality-wise. Students tend to ask their parents or siblings for help whenever facing difficulties. Busy parents not always willing to spend extra time explaining school material to their little one solve the problems themselves aiming to have more time for family, not lessons. As a result, the child will have the homework done. But that’s really not his work. So, the whole idea of dedicating time to self- education is lost here.  Finally, knowing that after classes you would still have to work at home makes a kid less concentrated at school. This results in short attention spans and difficulty to concentrate on something for too long.  All in all, homework should rather be an option. Students understanding that they areleft behind at some subjects will take their time to go over the material at home. However, in other cases, they should have time after school for other activities.

                                            over use it, 2. Read "Should Homework be Mandatory?" and answer the questions below. Should Homework be Mandatory? I can almost see many students nodding along with me as I ask this question. Younger generations overloaded with home tasks and numerous assignments have already raised this issue many times. Yet, homework remains mandatory, Is it fair or should it be canceled? I believe that homework should not be viewed as a mandatory part of education for several reasons. First, children spend seven hours every single workday at school. That is a huge chunk of life, and with homework added on top of these hours, a child is left with no time to live his life to the fullest, socialize, or grow in other areas. Second, sitting at your desk solving problems does no good to your health. Kids need time to get outside and have some fun, join a football league, or ride their bikes with friends around the block. Otherwise, children will be very smart but surprisingly weak physically. Another argument against this position is that homework is not always the best way to obtain knowledge quality-wise. Students tend to ask their parents or siblings for help whenever facing difficulties. Busy parents not always willing to spend extra time explaining school material to their little one solves the problems themselves aiming to have more time for family, not lessons. As a result, the child will have the homework done. But that's not his work. So, the whole idea of dedicating time to self-education is lost here. Finally, knowing that after classes you would still have to work at home makes a kid less concentrated at school. This results in short attention spans and difficulty to concentrate on something for too long. All in all, homework should rather be an option. Students understanding that they are left behind in some subjects will take their time to go over the material at home. However, in other cases, they should have time after school for other activities. What is the position paper about? . If you were the writer, what will be your stand? Defend your answer.

Essay on Education By: Priyanka Nagrale Countless words are written daily about the importance of education. Indubitably, education is the only valuable asset humans can achieve. Human evolution over eons is a result of education both formal and informal. Further, education is the sole basis on which the future of the human race depends. Our quest for knowledge is unending and will continue till planet Earth exists. How did you find the new information you have learned? I hope that you now pay attention to the basic elements of a position paper. Prepare to examine one in the next activities. Good Luck! Everyone speaks about education and its importance. Hence, let us understand what defines education. Briefly, education means acquiring knowledge. In broader terms, education means acquiring various skills in diverse fields that are vital to our life and very existence. These skills can be acquired by classroom training and during the course of our life. Classroom education is generally deemed as formal education. Whatever we learn and imbibe during our lifespan is informal education. Furthermore, knowledge and the innate human capability to learn continually distinguish us from other living creatures that inhabit this planet. https://surejob.in/importance-of-education.html​</a>

                            9. Should Homework be Mandatory? I can almost see many students nodding along with me as I ask this question. Younger generations overloaded with home tasks and numerous assignments have already raised this issue many times.  Yet, homework remains mandatory. Is it fair or should it be cancelled?  I believe that homework should not be viewed as a mandatory part of education for several reasons.  First, children spend seven hours every single workday at school. That is a huge chunk of life, and with homework added on top of these hours, a child is left with no time to live his life to the fullest, socialize, or grow in other areas. Second, sitting at your desk solving problems does no good to your health. Kids need time to get outside and have some fun, join a football league, or ride their bikes with friends around the block. Otherwise, children will be very smart but  surprisingly weak physically. Another argument against this position is that homework is not always the best way to obtain knowledge quality-wise. Students tend to ask their parents or siblings for help whenever facing difficulties. Busy parents not always willing to spend extra time explaining school material to their little one solve the problems themselves aiming to have more time for family, not lessons. As a result, the child will have the homework done. But that’s really not his work. So, the whole idea of dedicating time to self- education is lost here.  Finally, knowing that after classes you would still have to work at home makes a kid less concentrated at school. This results in short attention spans and difficulty to concentrate on something for too long.  All in all, homework should rather be an option. Students understanding that they areleft behind at some subjects will take their time to go over the material at home. However, in other cases, they should have time after school for other activities.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In my opinion, homework should not be mandatory. I believe that homework should be used as a way for students to reinforce what they have learned in class, and it should be up to the student to decide if they want to spend their time completing it. I believe that students learn best when they are in control of their own learning, and they should not be forced to complete assignments that are not helpful for them.</p><p></p><p>If I were the writer, I would argue that homework should not be mandatory. I would say that students should be allowed to decide for themselves if they want to complete homework, and that it should not be something that is forced upon them. I believe that homework can be helpful for some students, but that it is not something that should be required for all students. I would also argue that homework should not be counted towards a student's grade, as I believe that it should be something that is done solely for the purpose of reinforcing what was learned in class.</p><p></p>PLS PA HEART, FOLLOW AT PA BRAINLIEST TY<br />

Essay on Education By: Priyanka Nagrale Countless words are written daily about the importance of education. Indubitably, education is the only valuable asset humans can achieve. Human evolution over eons is a result of education both formal and informal. Further, education is the sole basis on which the future of the human race depends. Our quest for knowledge is unending and will continue till planet Earth exists. How did you find the new information you have learned? I hope that you now pay attention to the basic elements of a position paper. Prepare to examine one in the next activities. Good Luck! Everyone speaks about education and its importance. Hence, let us understand what defines education. Briefly, education means acquiring knowledge. In broader terms, education means acquiring various skills in diverse fields that are vital to our life and very existence. These skills can be acquired by classroom training and during the course of our life. Classroom education is generally deemed as formal education. Whatever we learn and imbibe during our lifespan is informal education. Furthermore, knowledge and the innate human capability to learn continually distinguish us from other living creatures that inhabit this planet. https://surejob.in/importance-of-education.html​</h2><br />
