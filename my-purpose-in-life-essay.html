                        My Purpose of Existence<p></p><p>-In all the essays that I have made throughout my academic life, I think this has been the most difficult question to answer or a difficult topic to ponder on. Maybe some have an idea of their purpose because they already know their passion, but some do not really know what their life is all about. Our last year’s topic was Existential Therapy and my professor once asked that why are we doing this when in fact, we are mortal beings? While I am thinking of my purpose, I also thought of asking myself the same question. Why am I wasting time thinking of my purpose when eventually I will die? But, at some point, I came to notice that death is real. I suddenly felt a strange feeling. I do not what it is but I only know that I do not like the idea of death and I do not want to disappear in this world because I haven’t done anything yet, I have not helped my parents to have a better life, and I am not yet contributing to the society. I came to realize that people who ask the question why usually take their life granted or maybe they are tired of life because of its demands and unfairness. On the other hand, I think I have an answer on why we need to know our purpose before we die—it is because our death would mean nothing. Dying without doing anything to your loved ones or to the society makes our life empty, Presently, that is my advocacy in life.
