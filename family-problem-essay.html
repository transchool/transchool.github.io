1. You are researching on an assignment in your subject in Media and Information Literacy. You came along an article online that amazingly can answer the research assignment perfectly well. You copy and pasted it into one great essay, complete with pictures and other visuals. You did not cite your references in order to impress your perfectionist and strict teacher.
2. A family friend, who also happens to be your classmate in one of your classes was
diagnosed with an incurable illness. Your close family ties enabled you to know the
status of her health, including its severity, and asked you to refrain from spilling out the information outside of your family circle. In order to help her with her absences and academic standing, you told your class adviser about her health status.
3. You are living in a peaceful community within your barangay where everyone practically knows everyone. Lately, there have been rumors circulating around the neighborhood that one of your friends is into illegal drugs. Upon investigation and personal interview, you found out that he is actually using marijuana because of an emotional problem within his family. You decided to help him by enlisting the help of psychologists and authorities in order to help him rehabilitate and cope with the problem. True enough, he was sent to a rehabilitation center in order to undergo debriefing. The news spread like wildfire within the neighborhood and soon, his family’s problems was then discussed out in the open. Your friend’s family have branded you a traitor for helping the “arrest” of your friend and ultimately revealing their problems to the entire neighborhood.</a>

You copy and pasted it into one great essay, complete with pictures and other visuals. You did not cite your references in order to impress your perfectionist and strict teacher. 2. A family friend, who also happens to be your classmate in one of your classes was diagnosed with an incurable illness. Your close family ties enabled you to know the status of her health, including its severity, and asked you to refrain from spilling out the information outside of your family circle. In order to help her with her absences and academic standing, you told your class adviser about her health status. 3. You are living in a peaceful community within your barangay where everyone practically knows everyone. Lately, there have been rumors circulating around the neighborhood that one of your friends is into illegal drugs. Upon investigation and personal interview, you found out that he is actually using marijuana because of an emotional problem within his family. You decided to help him by enlisting the help of psychologists and authorities in order to help him rehabilitate and cope with the problem. True enough, he was sent to a rehabilitation center in order to undergo debriefing. The news spread like wildfire within the neighborhood and soon, his family’s problems was then discussed out in the open. Your friend’s family have branded you a traitor for helping the “arrest” of your friend and ultimately revealing their problems to the entire neighborhood.​</a>

                        <p>Due to people's hectic lifestyles, <strong>family issues </strong>are becoming more and more prevalent without any apparent solutions. Both mothers and fathers work these days, and as a result, they<strong> don't have as much time</strong> to spend together, unwind more, travel, mingle with people, discuss personal issues, or look out for one another. Due to their busy schedules, getting the kids ready for school and taking care of the house are given top priority.</p><p>As a result, when they <strong>don't balance the role plays</strong>, they grow frustrated with one another, become stressed out, dispute, and fight. In the worst case scenario, they may even harm one another physically, especially when the husbands can't manage their emotions and threaten to kill their wives.</p><p>Between the first and fifth years of life, <strong>a child's intellect</strong> is like blotting paper. They take in all they see and hear, especially since their initial learning environment is the home, and they imitate their parents' actions.</p><p>Recent advancements in neurological research cast doubt on this assumption. It turns out, not surprisingly, that children's stress hormones rise when they hear yelling. Even an infant who is dozing off can hear yelling and experience a rush of stress hormones that takes some time to subside.</p><p>Therefore, the study supports what any child can tell you—that it's frightful when grownups shout at each other.

                            2. Essay about family problem and solution​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Family problems can arise due to a variety of reasons such as financial issues, communication breakdown, conflicts over values and beliefs, disagreements over household chores, and many more. These problems can cause stress, tension, and even breakdown in relationships among family members. However, there are several solutions that can be adopted to overcome these challenges and restore harmony in the family.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>One of the most important solutions is to establish effective communication within the family. Family members should be encouraged to share their thoughts and feelings with each other without fear of judgment or criticism. This can be achieved by setting aside time for family meetings where everyone has an opportunity to speak and listen to each other. Family members should also be encouraged to use active listening techniques, such as repeating what the other person has said, to ensure that they understand each other's perspectives.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Another solution is to establish clear boundaries and expectations within the family. This includes setting rules for behavior, such as respect for one another, honesty, and responsibility. When everyone understands the boundaries and expectations, there is less room for misunderstandings and conflicts.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Financial problems can also cause significant stress in families. A solution to this problem is to create a budget and stick to it. This requires a willingness to compromise and make sacrifices for the greater good of the family. Family members can also work together to find ways to increase their income or reduce their expenses. This could include taking on part-time jobs, cutting back on non-essential expenses, or finding ways to save money on necessary expenses.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>In some cases, family problems may require the assistance of a professional counselor or therapist. This can be particularly helpful when there are deep-rooted issues such as addiction, mental health problems, or past traumas that are affecting the family dynamic. A therapist can provide a safe and supportive environment for family members to express their feelings and work through their issues.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Finally, it is important for family members to make time for each other and prioritize their relationships. This could include scheduling regular family outings or activities, such as game nights or movie nights. It could also mean setting aside time each day to talk and connect with each other.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>In conclusion, family problems can be challenging, but they can be overcome with effective communication, clear boundaries and expectations, financial planning, professional help if necessary, and prioritizing relationships. By working together and supporting each other, families can overcome their problems and build stronger, healthier relationships.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Many families in the world have problems. Some of these problems are small, while others are much larger. However, no matter how serious it is, it can have an impact on the family. It's no secret that families can be a source of immense joy, but they can also be a source of significant stress and conflict. Family problems can take many forms, from financial stress to relationship difficulties. And while not every family will experience all these problems, most families will likely experience at least some of them at some point. That's why it's so helpful to talk about family problems. By talking about the issues we're facing, we can work together to find solutions and strengthen our families stronger. Not only that but talking about family problems can also help to reduce the stigma around them. Too often, people feel they have to keep their family problems to themselves, but this only makes things more difficult. We can help make it easier for others to do the same by talking about these issues. If you're facing family problems, know that you're not alone. And don't be afraid to reach out for help. There are many resources available for families who are struggling. With the support, you can get through anything.</p><p>One of the most common types of family problems is communication problems. Those with communication problems often have a hard time communicating with each other. Effective communication is essential to resolving family problems. It allows family members to express their feelings and needs safely and respectfully. It also allows for compromise and negotiation. Without communication, family members can quickly be resentful and frustrated, leading to even more problems. Communication is key. When communication breaks down, problems can quickly escalate and become unmanageable. Of course, communication is not always effortless. It requires effort and patience. Family members may not always be willing to listen or to compromise. But even in the most challenging situations, communication is still the most effective way to resolve problems.</p><p>Another common type of family problem is financial problems. Families who have financial problems often have a hard time making ends meet. This can lead to arguments and conflict. Financial issues can also make it difficult for family members to save money for future expenses.</p><p>Addiction is another common type of family problem. Those with addiction problems often have a hard time dealing with their addiction. This can lead to arguments and conflict. Addiction can also make it difficult for family members to get the help they need to recover from their addiction. If one or more family members are struggling with addiction, it can create a ripple effect on the entire family. Mental health problems can also be complicated for families to deal with. When a family member struggles with depression, anxiety, or another mental health issue, it can be challenging for the rest of the family to understand and support them.</p><p>Abuse is another common type of family problem. Families who have abuse problems have a hard time dealing with it. This can lead to arguments and conflict. Abuse can also make it difficult for family members to get the help they need to stop the abuse.</p><p>These are only a few examples of family problems. No family is flawless. Every family has difficulties, and some families have more problems than others.</p><p>In conclusion, family problems are a common occurrence that can happen to anyone. While they can be hard to deal with, there are several ways to overcome them. By communicating openly with family members, seeking outside support, and making a concerted effort to work through the issue, it is possible to resolve family problems.</p><br />
