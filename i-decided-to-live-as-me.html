                                            Last month, I went to one of the famous tourist spots in the Philippines, theBoracay. When I reached the place, I hurriedly checked-in into a hotel. Since, I arrivedearly, I decided to walk along the streets looking for something to eat. I found a uniquerestaurant. When I entered the place, I was assisted by a beautiful crew. The foods werecooked deliciously by the chef. I was so full when I left the place,As I looked around outside the restaurant, there were street children across thestreet where I was standing. Some of them were sitting, some were playing, and somewere asking for food to eat. I hurriedly went to the children and asked, "Where are yourparents ?"The four of us here don't have our parents anymores and these three beside mestill have their parents but are busy earning for a living" said the tallest boy among thechildren. For the whole period of my vacation I was with the kids. I asked permission tothe family. I bought them clothes to wear. I provided them food to eat. And wherever Iwent, they went with me. They were my tour guide. I considered them my own sincethey all behaved well. When it was time for me to go home, I had a heavy-heart leavingthe kids behind. One of the kids told me and held my hand, "Kuya, thank you for givingus everything and for the care you showed us." Then they all thanked me, and we did agroup hug.find the active sentences and change it to passive sentences vice versa​</a>

                                            not see that I straddle two cultures, nor that I feel displaced in the only country I know. I identify with Americans, but Americans do not identify with me. I've never known what it's like to belong to a community - neither one at large, nor of an extended family. I know more about Europe than the continent my ancestors unmistakably come from. I sometimes wonder, as I did that day in the dry cleaner's, if I would be a happier person bad my parents stayed in Korea. I first began to consider this thought around the time I decided to go to graduate school. It had been a compromise: my parents wanted me to go to law school; I wanted to skip the starched- collar track and be a writer - the hungrier the better. But after 20-some years of following their wishes and meeting all of their expectations, I couldn't bring myself to disobey or disappoint. A writing career is riskier than law, I remember thinking. If I'm a failure and my life is a washout, then what does that make my parents' lives? I know that many of my friends had to choose between pleasing their parents and being true to themselves. But for the children of immigrants, the choice seems more complicated, a happy outcome impossible. By making the biggest move of their lives for me, my parents indentured me to the largest debt imaginable - I owe them the fulfillment of their hopes for me. It tore me up inside to suppress my dream, but I went to school for a Ph.D. in English literature, thinking I had found the perfect compromise. I would be able to write at least about books while pursuing a graduate degree. Predictably, it didn't work out. How could I labor for five years in a program I had no passion for? When I finally left school, my parents were disappointed, but since it wasn't what they wanted me to do, they weren't devastated. I, on the other hand, felt I was staring at the bottom of the abyss. I had seen the flaw in my life of halfwayness, in my planned life of compromises. I hadn't thought about my love life, but I had a vague plan to make concessions there, too. Though they raised me as an American, my parents expect me to marry someone Korean and give them grandchildren who look like them. This didn't seem like such a huge request when I was 14, but now I don't know what I'm going to do. I've never been in love with someone I dated, or dated someone I loved. (Since I can't bring myself even to entertain the thought of marrying the non-Korean men I'm attracted to, I've been dating only those I know I can stay clearheaded about.) And as I near that age when the question of marriage stalks every relationship, I can't help but wonder if my parents' expectations are responsible for the lack of passion in my life. My parents didn't want their daughter to be Korean, but they don't want her fully American, either. Children of immigrants are living paradoxes. We are the first generation and the last. We are in this country for its opportunities, yet filial duty binds us. When my parents boarded the plane, they knew they were embarking on a rough trip. I don't think they imagined the rocks in the path of their daughter who can't even pronounce her own name.​</a>

                                            My Mother, My Strength!
My mother always reminds me of freshly baked breads. The feeling is so warm with a sweet fragrance.
And I cannot help being drawn over just like a newly born baby. Despite this, the feeling I have for my
mom is ever changing. She is like a rose, so tough and so beautiful. She teaches me all that she knows in
what she thinks is the most appropriate time and way, raising me up to be a mature, sensible and strongminded girl.
As I grew up, I became curious about child-bearing. I learned from books and movies that the process was
very painful. Then I asked my mom whether she felt pains when she gave birth to me. Her face cutely
turned red and said 'not at all' with blinking eyes. She told me that she was willing to bear the pains to
have a lovely daughter like me. I was so moved that I could never forget her gentle, loving face.
She teaches in a vocational high school, which I would not like to tell others when I was young because
she is more of a care-taker for those so-called bad students rather than a professional English teacher.
However, she changed my minds with her great passion for her teaching career. Students in her school
usually skip classes, addict themselves to the Internet, and have quarrels with parents and teachers. I
cannot imagine how my mom deals with them, especially when she is the head teacher in charge of
around 40 students like this. Surprisingly, those students adore my mom so much that they call her
Mother Fan, which I am envy of.
They often visit our home and sometimes bring her flowers after graduation. One student even called my
mom when she decided to attend a 'blind date' party. I am very confused at the beginning because those
students are known for poor teacher-student relationships. Then I asked one of them. She told me that my
mom was a wonderful teacher -- she never pushes students and she always give them useful life
suggestions. It was then that I started to be proud of my mother for her 'special' teaching job.
My mom is also of super help when I encounter problems. I remember having nightmares at a very young
age. No matter how late it was, she would go to my room, and hold me tight until I slept safe and sound
again. When I was a school girl, she kept a close contact with my teachers. When I had troubles with
studies, she never blamed me but gave me faith that I could keep up if I tried hard. She is also a wonderful
cook. She takes care of me with great patience and cooks me different dishes every day. My mom is very
thrifty in life. However, she is never mean when it comes to me. She is also incredibly far-sighted,
sending me to participate in summer camps when I entered secondary school, which made me very
independent. Now that I am in university and far away from her, she can no longer take care of me.
Instead she gives me constructive advice when necessary. For example, when I had my first boyfriend,
she taught me not to depend on him too much and keep my own social circles. My boyfriend joined the
exchange program this year and it turned out that I could live comfortably without him, which is largely
thanks to my mother's suggestion.
'Mama is the dearest person to you in the world', just as the old song goes. My mom is the dearest person
to me and I admire her because of her patience, compassion and toughness.

                                            My name is Shekinah. I have a big family. I understand the point of having such a big family. Living in a
big family is such a headache. I feel that I'm never alone for there is always somebody bothering me.
One day, my family planned a picnic together with my aunties, uncles and cousins. I thought it would be a
nice chance to spend some time with my friends so I made an alibi. I told them I will just stay home and do my
homework instead of going to the picnic. My parents were about to cancel the plan but somehow I managed to
make them leave.
Finally, after a long time I was alone at home. I felt good and excited so I started calling my friends to see
who's free for an outing. After around five calls, I came upon Jessa who was free for the day. The rest of them
were out with their families. We both decided to go to a nearby pool. We picked our motorcycles and set off. As
luck would have it, I met an accident on the way. One mornent I was in terrible pain and the next thing !
remembered I fainted. When I opened my eyes, I was in a hospital with a fractured leg and bandages here and
there. Jessa was not badly hurt so she called my parents and informed them about the accident,
I was now at home in bed. I knew everybody was angry because I lied to them. My mother asked about
the homework but my father told her to keep quiet for some time. From that day on, I saw a different kind of
family
Mother cooked for me whatever I wanted and made sure that I take my medicines. My father brought me books
to keep me busy. My brother would do whatever favor I ask from him. During weekends my aunties and uncles
brought me flowers and gifts. My other cousins told me jokes and stories to keep me in a good humor.
Two months had passed like this, I didn't feel bored or like a handicap even for a single day. It was then I
realized the importance of family. None of my friends were here to support me. I can't imagine what would
have happened to me if I was alone. I apologize to my parents for lying. My mother kissed me in the forehead
and said, "It's okay, I know you have learnt your lesson." I thank God for giving me such a loving family. I love
my family so much that I can't live without them.

One day, it was announced to the feelings that the island would sink, so all constructed boats and left. Except for Love. Love was the only who stayed. Love wanted to hold out until the last possible moment. When the island almost sunk, Love decided to ask for help. (2.) Richness was passing by Love in a grand boat. Love said, "Richness, can you take me with you?' Richness answered, "No, I can't. there is a lot of gold and silver in my boat. There is no place for you here." (3.) Love decided to ask Vanity who was also passing by in a beautiful vessel. "Vanity, please help me.!" I can't help you Love. You are all wet and might damage my boat," Vanity answered. (4.) Sadness was close by so Love asked, "Sadness, let me go with you." "Oh... Love, I am so sad that I need to be by myself!" (5.) Happiness passed by Love, too, but she was so happy that she did not even hear when Love called her. Suddenly, there was a voice. "Come, Love, I will take you." It was an elder. So blessed and overjoyed, Love even forgot to ask the elder where they were going. Wh they arrived at dry land, the elder went her own way. Realizing how much was owed elder, Love asked knowledge, another elder, "Who helped me?" "It was Time," know ne help me?"​</a>

                            7. Last month, I went to one of the famous tourist spots in the Philippines, theBoracay. When I reached the place, I hurriedly checked-in into a hotel. Since, I arrivedearly, I decided to walk along the streets looking for something to eat. I found a uniquerestaurant. When I entered the place, I was assisted by a beautiful crew. The foods werecooked deliciously by the chef. I was so full when I left the place,As I looked around outside the restaurant, there were street children across thestreet where I was standing. Some of them were sitting, some were playing, and somewere asking for food to eat. I hurriedly went to the children and asked, "Where are yourparents ?"The four of us here don't have our parents anymores and these three beside mestill have their parents but are busy earning for a living" said the tallest boy among thechildren. For the whole period of my vacation I was with the kids. I asked permission tothe family. I bought them clothes to wear. I provided them food to eat. And wherever Iwent, they went with me. They were my tour guide. I considered them my own sincethey all behaved well. When it was time for me to go home, I had a heavy-heart leavingthe kids behind. One of the kids told me and held my hand, "Kuya, thank you for givingus everything and for the care you showed us."

                            8. not see that I straddle two cultures, nor that I feel displaced in the only country I know. I identify with Americans, but Americans do not identify with me. I've never known what it's like to belong to a community - neither one at large, nor of an extended family. I know more about Europe than the continent my ancestors unmistakably come from. I sometimes wonder, as I did that day in the dry cleaner's, if I would be a happier person bad my parents stayed in Korea. I first began to consider this thought around the time I decided to go to graduate school. It had been a compromise: my parents wanted me to go to law school; I wanted to skip the starched- collar track and be a writer - the hungrier the better. But after 20-some years of following their wishes and meeting all of their expectations, I couldn't bring myself to disobey or disappoint. A writing career is riskier than law, I remember thinking. If I'm a failure and my life is a washout, then what does that make my parents' lives? I know that many of my friends had to choose between pleasing their parents and being true to themselves. But for the children of immigrants, the choice seems more complicated, a happy outcome impossible. By making the biggest move of their lives for me, my parents indentured me to the largest debt imaginable - I owe them the fulfillment of their hopes for me. It tore me up inside to suppress my dream, but I went to school for a Ph.D. in English literature, thinking I had found the perfect compromise. I would be able to write at least about books while pursuing a graduate degree. Predictably, it didn't work out. How could I labor for five years in a program I had no passion for? When I finally left school, my parents were disappointed, but since it wasn't what they wanted me to do, they weren't devastated. I, on the other hand, felt I was staring at the bottom of the abyss. I had seen the flaw in my life of halfwayness, in my planned life of compromises. I hadn't thought about my love life, but I had a vague plan to make concessions there, too. Though they raised me as an American, my parents expect me to marry someone Korean and give them grandchildren who look like them. This didn't seem like such a huge request when I was 14, but now I don't know what I'm going to do. I've never been in love with someone I dated, or dated someone I loved. (Since I can't bring myself even to entertain the thought of marrying the non-Korean men I'm attracted to, I've been dating only those I know I can stay clearheaded about.) And as I near that age when the question of marriage stalks every relationship, I can't help but wonder if my parents' expectations are responsible for the lack of passion in my life. My parents didn't want their daughter to be Korean, but they don't want her fully American, either. Children of immigrants are living paradoxes. We are the first generation and the last. We are in this country for its opportunities, yet filial duty binds us. When my parents boarded the plane, they knew they were embarking on a rough trip. I don't think they imagined the rocks in the path of their daughter who can't even pronounce her own name.​</h2><br />

                            12. My name is Shekinah. I have a big family. I understand the point of having such a big family. Living in abig family is such a headache. I feel that I'm never alone for there is always somebody bothering me.One day, my family planned a picnic together with my aunties, uncles and cousins. I thought it would be anice chance to spend some time with my friends so I made an alibi. I told them I will just stay home and do myhomework instead of going to the picnic. My parents were about to cancel the plan but somehow I managed tomake them leave.Finally, after a long time I was alone at home. I felt good and excited so I started calling my friends to seewho's free for an outing. After around five calls, I came upon Jessa who was free for the day. The rest of themwere out with their families. We both decided to go to a nearby pool. We picked our motorcycles and set off. Asluck would have it, I met an accident on the way. One mornent I was in terrible pain and the next thing !remembered I fainted. When I opened my eyes, I was in a hospital with a fractured leg and bandages here andthere. Jessa was not badly hurt so she called my parents and informed them about the accident,I was now at home in bed. I knew everybody was angry because I lied to them. My mother asked aboutthe homework but my father told her to keep quiet for some time. From that day on, I saw a different kind offamilyMother cooked for me whatever I wanted and made sure that I take my medicines. My father brought me booksto keep me busy. My brother would do whatever favor I ask from him. During weekends my aunties and unclesbrought me flowers and gifts. My other cousins told me jokes and stories to keep me in a good humor.Two months had passed like this, I didn't feel bored or like a handicap even for a single day. It was then Irealized the importance of family. None of my friends were here to support me. I can't imagine what wouldhave happened to me if I was alone. I apologize to my parents for lying. My mother kissed me in the foreheadand said, "It's okay, I know you have learnt your lesson." I thank God for giving me such a loving family. I lovemy family so much that I can't live without them.Activity 1Directions: Answer the following questions based from the story read. Use your English activity notebook.Guide Questions:1.

                            14. My Mother, My Strength!
My mother always reminds me of freshly baked breads. The feeling is so warm with a sweet fragrance.
And I cannot help being drawn over just like a newly born baby. Despite this, the feeling I have for my
mom is ever changing. She is like a rose, so tough and so beautiful. She teaches me all that she knows in
what she thinks is the most appropriate time and way, raising me up to be a mature, sensible and strongminded girl.
As I grew up, I became curious about child-bearing. I learned from books and movies that the process was
very painful. Then I asked my mom whether she felt pains when she gave birth to me. Her face cutely
turned red and said 'not at all' with blinking eyes. She told me that she was willing to bear the pains to
have a lovely daughter like me. I was so moved that I could never forget her gentle, loving face.
She teaches in a vocational high school, which I would not like to tell others when I was young because
she is more of a care-taker for those so-called bad students rather than a professional English teacher.
However, she changed my minds with her great passion for her teaching career. Students in her school
usually skip classes, addict themselves to the Internet, and have quarrels with parents and teachers. I
cannot imagine how my mom deals with them, especially when she is the head teacher in charge of
around 40 students like this. Surprisingly, those students adore my mom so much that they call her
Mother Fan, which I am envy of.
They often visit our home and sometimes bring her flowers after graduation. One student even called my
mom when she decided to attend a 'blind date' party. I am very confused at the beginning because those
students are known for poor teacher-student relationships. Then I asked one of them. She told me that my
mom was a wonderful teacher -- she never pushes students and she always give them useful life
suggestions. It was then that I started to be proud of my mother for her 'special' teaching job.
My mom is also of super help when I encounter problems. I remember having nightmares at a very young
age. No matter how late it was, she would go to my room, and hold me tight until I slept safe and sound
again. When I was a school girl, she kept a close contact with my teachers. When I had troubles with
studies, she never blamed me but gave me faith that I could keep up if I tried hard. She is also a wonderful
cook. She takes care of me with great patience and cooks me different dishes every day. My mom is very
thrifty in life. However, she is never mean when it comes to me. She is also incredibly far-sighted,
sending me to participate in summer camps when I entered secondary school, which made me very
independent. Now that I am in university and far away from her, she can no longer take care of me.
Instead she gives me constructive advice when necessary. For example, when I had my first boyfriend,
she taught me not to depend on him too much and keep my own social circles. My boyfriend joined the
exchange program this year and it turned out that I could live comfortably without him, which is largely
thanks to my mother's suggestion.
'Mama is the dearest person to you in the world', just as the old song goes. My mom is the dearest person
to me and I admire her because of her patience, compassion and toughness.

                            26. Love and Time (1.)Once upon a time, there was an island where all the feelings lived: Happiness. Sadness, Knowledge, and all of the others, including Love. One day, it was announced to the feelings that the island would sink, so all constructed boats and left. Except for Love. Love was the only who stayed. Love wanted to hold out until the last possible moment. When the island almost sunk, Love decided to ask for help. (2.) Richness was passing by Love in a grand boat. Love said, "Richness, can you take me with you?' Richness answered, "No, I can't. there is a lot of gold and silver in my boat. There is no place for you here." (3.) Love decided to ask Vanity who was also passing by in a beautiful vessel. "Vanity, please help me.!" I can't help you Love. You are all wet and might damage my boat," Vanity answered. (4.) Sadness was close by so Love asked, "Sadness, let me go with you." "Oh... Love, I am so sad that I need to be by myself!" (5.) Happiness passed by Love, too, but she was so happy that she did not even hear when Love called her. Suddenly, there was a voice. "Come, Love, I will take you." It was an elder.

                        How do I know myself? I’m not quite sure, because sometimes small things can make me angry. <br />But I know I will be able to manage it. I like to paint, draw, do crochets, and do some other fun activities. Sometimes, I may be scared trying new things but it is not bad because my family always cheers me up. <br />When talking about rights and wrongs. I have every right to fulfill my needs, but not my wants. I have every right to my freedom of speech, but hate speech isn’t free speech. I have every right to have an education, but use it as a key to help those who need help with knowledge. I have every right to play but have time management so I can do my responsibilities. I have every right to criticize the wrongdoings of the government but praise them whenever I see that they are doing the right thing. <br /><br />

                            30. My name is Shekinah. I have a big family. I understand the point of having such a big family. Living in a big family is such a headache. I feel that I'm never alone for there is always somebody bothering me. One day, my family planned a picnic together with my aunties, uncles and cousins. I thought it would be a nice chance to spend some time with my friends so I made an alibi 1 told them i will just stay home and do my homework instead of going to the picnic. My parents were about to cancel the plan but somehow I managed to make them leave. Finally, after a long time I was alone at home. I felt good and excited so I started calling my friends to see who's free for an outing. After around five calls, I came upon Jessa who was free for the day. The rest of them were out with their families. We both decided to go to a nearby pool. We picked our motorcycles and set off. As luck would have it, I met an accident on the way. One moment I was in terrible pain and the next thing I remembered I fainted. When I opened my eyes, I was in a hospital with a fractured leg and bandages here and there. Jessa was not badly hurt so she called my parents and informed them about the accident, I was now at home in bed. I knew everybody was angry because I lied to them. My mother asked about the homework but my father told her to keep quiet for some time. From that day on, I saw a different kind of family Mother cooked for me whatever I wanted and made sure that I take my medicines. My father brought me books to keep me busy. My brother would do whatever favor I ask from him. During weekends my aunties and uncles brought me flowers and gifts. My other cousins told me jokes and stories to keep me in a good humor. Two months had passed like this, I didn't feel bored or like a handicap even for a single day. It was then I realized the importance of family. None of my friends were here to support me. I can't imagine what would have happened to me if I was alone. I apologize to my parents for lying. My mother kissed me in the forehead and said, "It's okay, I know you have learnt your lesson." I thank God for giving me such a loving family. I love my family so much that I can't live without them.
