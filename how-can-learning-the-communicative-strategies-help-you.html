Before, an audio can be created and transmitted through tape, radio, or CD. Today, a different alternative is offered by the Internet - the podcast. You may have encountered the term in your previous lesson in Listening Strategies. It is a digital audio file that is posted on the Internet. For you to practice the guidelines in conducting an interview, interview an expert on any field (Example: teacher, nurse, engineer, etc.). Imagine you will produce a 5-minute informative podcast about your interviewee's expertise 1. First, copy and accomplish the template on "Interview Plan" in your paper. Then, provide the interviewee with a copy of the interview questions to allow him/her to prepare answers. Remember to use open-ended questions. (Example: What advice would you give someone who like to follow a similar career to yours?) Interview Plan Interviewer Purpose of interview: Interviewee:Information I know about the Interviewee: Job Position/Title: Workplace: Years in service/practice: Others: Possible Questions: 1. 2.3.4.5.Answers:1.2.3.4.5.2. If a smartphone or any sound recorder is available, you can use it to record the interview. You can use your recording to complete the last part of your Interview Plan where you will write your interviewee's answers. Remember to use a direct speech or write the exact answers of your interviewee. 3. After the interview, reflect on the questions that follow. Write your answers on your paper. ►► What was it like to interview someone? ►►Which of the tips or guidelines did you use, and how did it help you as an interviewer? ►► GOOD AND HELPFUL ANSWER = BRAINLIEST ►►NONSENSE ANSWER = REPORT!! ​</a>

Before, an audio can be created and transmitted through tape, radio, or CD. Today, a different alternative is offered by the Internet - the podcast. You may have encountered the term in your previous lesson in Listening Strategies. It is a digital audio file that is posted on the Internet. For you to practice the guidelines in conducting an interview, interview an expert on any field (Example: teacher, nurse, engineer, etc.). Imagine you will produce a 5-minute informative podcast about your interviewee's expertise 1. First, copy and accomplish the template on "Interview Plan" in your paper. Then, provide the interviewee with a copy of the interview questions to allow him/her to prepare answers. Remember to use open-ended questions. (Example: What advice would you give someone who like to follow a similar career to yours?) Interview Plan Interviewer Purpose of interview: Interviewee:Information I know about the Interviewee: Job Position/Title: Workplace: Years in service/practice: Others: Possible Questions: 1. 2.3.4.5.Answers:1.2.3.4.5.2. If a smartphone or any sound recorder is available, you can use it to record the interview. You can use your recording to complete the last part of your Interview Plan where you will write your interviewee's answers. Remember to use a direct speech or write the exact answers of your interviewee. 3. After the interview, reflect on the questions that follow. Write your answers on your paper. ►► What was it like to interview someone? ►►Which of the tips or guidelines did you use, and how did it help you as an interviewer? ►► GOOD AND HELPFUL ANSWER = BRAINLIEST ►►NONSENSE ANSWER = REPORT!! ​</h2><br />
