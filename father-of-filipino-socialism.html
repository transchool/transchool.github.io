                            29. REFLECTION: (Journal Writing) During the pandemic, the National government is planning to give Social Amelioration Program to the qualified Filipino families, and according to Hon Vico Sotto, Mayor of Pasig City, the local government will give Supplemental SAP amounting to Php 8,000 to those families who are not included in the list of the DSWD. What do you think is the effect if your father is a beneficiary of the DSWD and at the same time his name is also included in the Supplemental SAP? pahelp po, thank u!​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>MANILA, Philippines-Pasig Mayor Vico</p><p>Sotto on Sunday announced that the city</p><p>government would provide a subsidy</p><p>to its residents not covered by the</p><p>national government's social amelioration</p><p>program (SAP).</p><p>In a virtual briefing, Sotto said the city</p><p>government listed 206,000 families</p><p>in their city for the SAP. However, only</p><p>93,000 families were approved.</p><p>Under the SAP, low-income households</p><p>will receive up to P8,000 in cash per</p><p>month a part of the government's</p><p>response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Families will receive the amount for two</p><p>months, meaning qualified families can</p><p>receive up to P16,000."We can't afford the amount of P8,000</p><p>for two months or P16,000. We can't</p><p>afford that big an amount. But we will do</p><p>whatever we can," Sotto said.</p><p>"We will look for funds so that we could</p><p>realign. Or we will put out the money</p><p>that Pasig has in its trust fund, with the</p><p>permission of our City Council, which we</p><p>know will also help us," he added.</p><p>Sotto said that the city was looking into</p><p>providing P8,000 per family under its</p><p>own version of the SAP. This amount,</p><p>however, is still not final as the city</p><p>budget still needs to be considered.</p><p></p><br />
