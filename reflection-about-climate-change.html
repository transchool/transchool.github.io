                                            15. How is the term greenhouse effect defined in the text below? Is it formal, informal or expanded?Encircle the correct answer.The so-called greenhouse effect is an atmospheric process by which a portion of the sun's heat istrapped within the earth's atmosphere, making the earth's surface warmer than it would otherwise be.Life on earth is possible because there is liquid water, a blanket of life-supporting gases, and a climateneither too warm nor too cold. Human beings may now be altering this balance by adding unusual amountsof carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. This could make the global climate warmer than at any other timein human history. And this change would be irreversible.The atmosphere contains 75% nitrogen, 23% oxygen, with argon, water vapor, and trace gases--includingcarbon dioxide--making up the remaining 2%. Carbon dioxide is an odorless, colorless gas whichconstitutes about 0.035%. It is essential for photosynthesis, the process by which the sun's energy isconverted into forms usable by plants and animals.Carbon dioxide affects the heat balance by acting as a one-way screen. It is transparent to incomingvisible sunlight and allows the sun's heat to warm the ocean and the land. But carbon dioxide moleculesblock some of the infrared heat radiated back into space. This reflected heat is absorbed into the loweratmosphere. This is the so-called greenhouse effect.​</a>

                                            6. This story reminds me of a vacation we took to my uncle's house in Rizal.7. This character has the same problem that I read about in a story last year.8. I saw a program on television that talked about things described in this article.9. The scenario in the story made me remember what our family experienced when TyphoonOndoy hit the country.10. The movie that I've watched reflects what's happening in our country today.11. The image reflects the effects of climate change that the world is currently experiencing.12. OMG! Something similar happened to me, when I forgot to bring my wallet.13. The friendship of the two characters in the story reminds me of the relationship I have withmy best friend14. The video we watch yesterday is somewhat similar to the lesson in our science subject.15. The drama that I'm watching has the same plot with the novel that I read last month.16. Ken is reading a book about rockets. He thinks that something he read contradicts a facthe saw in another book, so he makes a note to look it up when he gets home.17. Eddie is reading a book where a character visits a loved one in the hospital. It remindsEddie of when he visited his grandmother in the hospital.18. Kyla is reading a science fiction story. In the story, she thinks that what happens to thecharacters could also happen on Earth if people don't start recycling more.19. Leo is reading a book about Hispanic culture. It reminds this of his friend Robby, and thefood his family makes.20. Wei is reading a book about communist society. It reminds him of the government in aparticular country.A.TEXT-TEXT CONNECTIONB.TEXT-SELF CONNECTIONC.TEXT-WORLD CONNECTION​</a>

Global warming is the gradual increase in the normal temperature of the earth's climate because the heightened amount of heat energy from the sun striking the earth is being caught up in the atmosphere and not emitted into space. The earth's atmosphere has always accumulated the sun's heat acting like a greenhouse, making sure that the earth maintains temperatures that permit the emergence of life forms as we know them, including humans. Without this greenhouse in the atmosphere, the earth would be freezing. Global warming, however, equates to a greenhouse with highly efficient reflective glass positioned the other way around.

                            4. 15. How is the term greenhouse effect defined in the text below? Is it formal, informal or expanded?Encircle the correct answer.The so-called greenhouse effect is an atmospheric process by which a portion of the sun's heat istrapped within the earth's atmosphere, making the earth's surface warmer than it would otherwise be.Life on earth is possible because there is liquid water, a blanket of life-supporting gases, and a climateneither too warm nor too cold. Human beings may now be altering this balance by adding unusual amountsof carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. This could make the global climate warmer than at any other timein human history. And this change would be irreversible.The atmosphere contains 75% nitrogen, 23% oxygen, with argon, water vapor, and trace gases--includingcarbon dioxide--making up the remaining 2%. Carbon dioxide is an odorless, colorless gas whichconstitutes about 0.035%. It is essential for photosynthesis, the process by which the sun's energy isconverted into forms usable by plants and animals.Carbon dioxide affects the heat balance by acting as a one-way screen. It is transparent to incomingvisible sunlight and allows the sun's heat to warm the ocean and the land. But carbon dioxide moleculesblock some of the infrared heat radiated back into space. This reflected heat is absorbed into the loweratmosphere. This is the so-called greenhouse effect.​</h2><br />

Global warming is the gradual increase in the normal temperature of the earth's climate because the heightened amount of heat energy from the sun striking the earth is being caught up in the atmosphere and not emitted into space. The earth's atmosphere has always accumulated the sun's heat acting like a greenhouse, making sure that the earth maintains temperatures that permit the emergence of life forms as we know them, including humans. Without this greenhouse in the atmosphere, the earth would be freezing. Global warming, however, equates to a greenhouse with highly efficient reflective glass positioned the other way around.

                        <p>droughts more likely to occur - and more severe when they do - in parts of the United States. While the US is no stranger to drought, climate change has exacerbated drought conditions so that when droughts occur, it is in a hotter climate and, in some cases, with lower precipitation. This has serious consequences on the quality and quantity of water available for use by people and ecosystems. Droughts worsened by climate change are impacting agriculture, energy production, industry, recreation and are having serious consequences on human health and wellbeing. Disadvantaged groups suffer disproportionately from the adverse effects of climate change, resulting in greater inequality.</p><br />
