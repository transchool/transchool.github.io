Fill in the graphic organizer to complete the story grammar that follows. A Glass of Milk Once upon a time, there was a poor boy who made for his living by selling newspapers from door-to-door. This was the way he used to earn money to pay the fees for his school. One day, as he was walking from house to house distributing newspapers, as usual, he felt very low and was starving. He felt that he could not walk anymore. He was so hungry that he decided to ask for food at one of the houses. As he knocked on the door, he was astonished to see a beautiful young giri opening the door. With much hesitation, he asked the girl for a glass of water. The young girl immediately understood the poor boy's condition and offered him a huge glass of milk. With a surprising look, the boy drank the milk and thanked the pretty girl.

Following all the protocols, such as, always washing your hands, always wearing a mask, social distancing, avoiding touching your face, etc. Its incredible and frightening how fast everything changes, as well as how fast time flies fast. And yet, in the middle of the health pandemic, we are learning many powerful lessons. Recognizing how important the smallest of things are to us a haircut, hanging out with friends at a restaurant, school and games, we vow never to take anything for granted again. I keep thinking it’s a bad movie playing in my dream. A bad movie that you cannot turn off, it just keeps causing devastation. In short, I learned to appreciate the life I once had.Thanks &lt;3​</a>

                                            The defeat of Japan in World War II also meant the regaining of Philippine independence. Since then, we struggled to rebuild our communities and the structures of our democracy. Filipinos lived their liberated hopes and dreams until the establishment of the 1973 Marcos Constitution. This placed the entire nation under the authoritarian rule of President Ferdinand Marcos. We have once again lost our freedom. We have once again succumbed to the mercy not of foreign colonizers but of a fellow Filipino wanting to pursue his development ideologies. The dictator initially delivered the needs of the Filipino people by improving infrastructures and government systems. After 13 years under Martial Law the people became fed up with so much corruption, injustice and violence that eventually led to EDSA Revolution. The People Power in EDSA remains to be a compelling message to the world that the Filipinos value freedom so dearly. PAKI EXPLAIN THANK YOU​</a>

Which do you think comes first? Chickens or eggs.
To me eggs are first because forsooth, without eggs there will certainly be no chickens, you can see this from the life cycle of chickens, how do you think a chicken will be born if there is no egg cracking at all? describing the life cycle, you will realize it, that is my explanation, thank you!

Following all the protocols, such as, always washing your hands, always wearing a mask, social distancing, avoiding touching your face, etc. Its incredible and frightening how fast everything changes, as well as how fast time flies fast. And yet, in the middle of the health pandemic, we are learning many powerful lessons. Recognizing how important the smallest of things are to us a haircut, hanging out with friends at a restaurant, school and games, we vow never to take anything for granted again. I keep thinking it’s a bad movie playing in my dream. A bad movie that you cannot turn off, it just keeps causing devastation. In short, I learned to appreciate the life I once had.Thanks &lt;3​</h2><br />

                            14. The defeat of Japan in World War II also meant the regaining of Philippine independence. Since then, we struggled to rebuild our communities and the structures of our democracy. Filipinos lived their liberated hopes and dreams until the establishment of the 1973 Marcos Constitution. This placed the entire nation under the authoritarian rule of President Ferdinand Marcos. We have once again lost our freedom. We have once again succumbed to the mercy not of foreign colonizers but of a fellow Filipino wanting to pursue his development ideologies. The dictator initially delivered the needs of the Filipino people by improving infrastructures and government systems. After 13 years under Martial Law the people became fed up with so much corruption, injustice and violence that eventually led to EDSA Revolution. The People Power in EDSA remains to be a compelling message to the world that the Filipinos value freedom so dearly. PAKI EXPLAIN THANK YOU​</h2><br />

A Glass of Milk Once upon a time, there was a poor boy who made for his living by selling newspapers from door-to-door. This was the way he used to earn money to pay the fees for his school. One day, as he was walking from house to house distributing newspapers, as usual, he felt very low and was starving. He felt that he could not walk anymore. He was so hungry that he decided to ask for food at one of the houses. As he knocked on the door, he was astonished to see a beautiful young giri opening the door. With much hesitation, he asked the girl for a glass of water. The young girl immediately understood the poor boy's condition and offered him a huge glass of milk. With a surprising look, the boy drank the milk and thanked the pretty girl. The newspaper boy asked, "How much do I owe you for this milk?" "I don't want any money for this," replied the girl in a very soit voice. The boy once again thanked the girl with all his heart and left the place.​</h2><br />

Which do you think comes first? Chickens or eggs.
To me eggs are first because forsooth, without eggs there will certainly be no chickens, you can see this from the life cycle of chickens, how do you think a chicken will be born if there is no egg cracking at all? describing the life cycle, you will realize it, that is my explanation, thank you! No hate comments please, I am narrowly explaining my answer, but if I see one, I am unreservedly fine with that because who am I to be mad, it's either your facts or opinions, thank you once again!</h2><br />
