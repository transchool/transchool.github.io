                                            Performance Task 4. Directions: Read the news articles below. Take note of the important details to be able to fill out the table that follows.A :3 nurses test positive for COVID-19 ahter geling vaccine Three nurses who received a Sinovac vaccine are now in quarantine after testing positive for COVID-19.Infectious Diseases Specialist, Dr. Rontgene Solante, explains an infection is still possible if the person had the virus o day or two before getting vaccinated or when exposed to the virus before the antibodies kicked in. Filipino Nurses United President Moristella Abenojor says the nurses got the Sinovac vaccino on March 1st and even administered vaccines or assisted in the Immunization program. They were swabbed after a week and tested positive on March 9. They are asymptomatic. Dr. Solanle explains that a person will only get some protection from the virus on the second week after vaccination. That's when the body would have started producing enough antibodies to help light the infection. Almost 216,000 frontline health workers got the first dose of Sinovac and AstraZeneca vaccines. The Filipino Nurses United is calling for paid leave if they experience any side effect which could hinder thern from working. Meanwhile, the Filipino Infectious Diseases Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology says pregnant women who are at high risk of exposure to COVID-19 infection as well as lactating mothers may receive a COVID-19 vaccine despite lirnited studies on its safety and efficacy, but this is still upon doctor's assessment and should only be offered to pregnant and breastfeeding women at high-risk groups such as frontline health workers and uniformed personnel. They recommend it during the second or third trimester of pregnancy. Doctors say those who have just given birth may also be vaccinated against COVID-19, but they must wait two weeks after receiving a different type of vaccine like anti-tetanus or flu shots. - Carolyn Bonquin, B :CNN Philippines, Mar. 17, 2021 B Duterte to China: PH won't withdraw ships from West Philippine Sea By: Krissy Agullar - Reporter / KAquilarina INQUIRER.net/01:35 PM May 14.2021 MANILA, Philippines - President Rodrigo Duterte has declared that the Philippines will not withdraw its assets from the disputed parts of the West Philippine Sea while also insisting he does not intend to quarrel with China due to the country's "debt of grolllude" to them, We have a stand here and I want to stato it here and now again.

( 20 points ) 3 NURSES TEST POSITIVE FOR COVID-19 AFTER GETTING VACCINE        Three nurses who received a Sinovac vaccine are now in quarantine after testing positive for COVID-19. Infectious Diseases Specialist, Dr. Rontgene Solante, explains an infection is still possible if the person had the virus a day or two before getting vaccinated or when exposed to the virus before the antibodies kicked in.      Filipino Nurses United President Maristella Abenojar says the nurses got the Sinovac vaccine on March 1st and even administered vaccines or assisted in the immunization program. They were swabbed after a week and tested positive on March 9. They are asymptomatic. Dr. Solante explains that a person will only get some protection from the virus on the second week after vaccination. That’s when the body would have started producing enough antibodies to help fight the infection.        Almost 216,000 frontline health workers got the first dose of Sinovac and AstraZeneca vaccines. The Filipino Nurses United is calling for paid leave if they experience any side effect which could hinder them from working. Meanwhile, the Filipino Infectious Diseases Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology says pregnant women who are at high risk of exposure to COVID-19 infection as well as lactating mothers may receive a COVID-19 vaccine despite limited studies on its safety and efficacy, but this is still upon doctor’s assessment and should only be offered to pregnant and breastfeeding women at high-risk groups such as frontline health workers and uniformed personnel. They recommend it during the second or third trimester of pregnancy. Doctors say those who have just given birth may also be vaccinated against COVID-19, but they must wait two weeks after receiving a different type of vaccine like anti-tetanus or flu shots. – Carolyn Bonquin, CNN Philippines, Mar. 17, 2021 Answer the following : 1.

CNN Philippines, Mar. 17, 2021B. Duterte to China: PH won't withdraw ships from West Philippine Sea By: Krissy Aguilar - Reporter / @KAquilarINQ INQUIRER.net/01:35 PM May 14, 2021 MANILA, Philippines - President Rodrigo Duterte has declared that the Philippines will not withdraw its assets from the disputed parts of the West Philippine Sea while also insisting he does not intend to quarrel with China due to the country's "debt of gratitude" to them. "We have a stand here and I want to state it here and now again. Na yung mga barko natin nandyan ngayon sa Pag-asa at saan po, we will not move an inch backward." Duterte said in the second part of his taped speech aired Friday. (We have a stand here and I want to state it here and now again. That our ships are there in Pag-asa Island and somewhere else, we will not move an inch backward.) "Ayoko mokipagaway nga sa China, Inuulit ko, may utang ng loob kami. Malaki, malaki ang utang ng loob. Buhay ang tinulong nya sa amin. Pero yung ano naman ng bayan namin, sana maintindihan ninyo," he added, (I don't want to quarrel with China, I repeat, we have a debt of gratitude. A big one. They helped us with our lives. But I hope you understand the interest of our nation.) Duterte noted this is "what's supposed to be done by any president of any self-respecting republic." In the same televised speech, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana told Duterte the country's assets are deployed at the Kalayaan Island Group. "I'd like to put notice on China. May dalawang barko ako dyan...Sabihin ko sa China ngayon, as I said before, I am not ready to withdraw. I don't want a quarrel, I don't want trouble, I respect your position and you respect mine," Duterte said. (I have two ships there. Let me tell China now, as I said before. I am not ready to withdraw. I don't want a quarrel. I don't want trouble. I respect your position and you respect mine.) The President sold it is not wrong to admit that the Philippines is "inferior" in terms of "might and power." "Ngayon, hindi talaga ako aatras. Patayin mo man ako dito ako. Dito magtapos ang ating pagkakaibigan," he went on. (Now, I really won't withdraw. Even if you kill me. I will be here. This is when the friendship ends.) The Issuea.b. The Speaker's Standa.b.

( 20 points ) 3 NURSES TEST POSITIVE FOR COVID-19 AFTER GETTING VACCINE        Three nurses who received a Sinovac vaccine are now in quarantine after testing positive for COVID-19. Infectious Diseases Specialist, Dr. Rontgene Solante, explains an infection is still possible if the person had the virus a day or two before getting vaccinated or when exposed to the virus before the antibodies kicked in.      Filipino Nurses United President Maristella Abenojar says the nurses got the Sinovac vaccine on March 1st and even administered vaccines or assisted in the immunization program. They were swabbed after a week and tested positive on March 9. They are asymptomatic. Dr. Solante explains that a person will only get some protection from the virus on the second week after vaccination. That’s when the body would have started producing enough antibodies to help fight the infection.        Almost 216,000 frontline health workers got the first dose of Sinovac and AstraZeneca vaccines. The Filipino Nurses United is calling for paid leave if they experience any side effect which could hinder them from working. Meanwhile, the Filipino Infectious Diseases Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology says pregnant women who are at high risk of exposure to COVID-19 infection as well as lactating mothers may receive a COVID-19 vaccine despite limited studies on its safety and efficacy, but this is still upon doctor’s assessment and should only be offered to pregnant and breastfeeding women at high-risk groups such as frontline health workers and uniformed personnel.

Duterte to China: PH won't withdraw ships from West Philippine Sea By: Krissy Aguilar - Reporter / @KAquilarINQ INQUIRER.net/01:35 PM May 14, 2021 MANILA, Philippines - President Rodrigo Duterte has declared that the Philippines will not withdraw its assets from the disputed parts of the West Philippine Sea while also insisting he does not intend to quarrel with China due to the country's "debt of gratitude" to them. "We have a stand here and I want to state it here and now again. Na yung mga barko natin nandyan ngayon sa Pag-asa at saan po, we will not move an inch backward." Duterte said in the second part of his taped speech aired Friday. (We have a stand here and I want to state it here and now again. That our ships are there in Pag-asa Island and somewhere else, we will not move an inch backward.) "Ayoko mokipagaway nga sa China, Inuulit ko, may utang ng loob kami. Malaki, malaki ang utang ng loob. Buhay ang tinulong nya sa amin. Pero yung ano naman ng bayan namin, sana maintindihan ninyo," he added, (I don't want to quarrel with China, I repeat, we have a debt of gratitude. A big one. They helped us with our lives. But I hope you understand the interest of our nation.) Duterte noted this is "what's supposed to be done by any president of any self-respecting republic." In the same televised speech, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana told Duterte the country's assets are deployed at the Kalayaan Island Group. "I'd like to put notice on China. May dalawang barko ako dyan...Sabihin ko sa China ngayon, as I said before, I am not ready to withdraw. I don't want a quarrel, I don't want trouble, I respect your position and you respect mine," Duterte said. (I have two ships there. Let me tell China now, as I said before. I am not ready to withdraw. I don't want a quarrel. I don't want trouble. I respect your position and you respect mine.) The President sold it is not wrong to admit that the Philippines is "inferior" in terms of "might and power." "Ngayon, hindi talaga ako aatras. Patayin mo man ako dito ako. Dito magtapos ang ating pagkakaibigan," he went on. (Now, I really won't withdraw. Even if you kill me. I will be here. This is when the friendship ends.) The Issuea.b. The Speaker's Standa.b.
