                                            Discover This lesson will deal with construction of regular polygona using compass and straightedge. VHAT IS A REGULAR POLYGONP Regular polygons have equal sides and equal interior angles. Some examples of regular polygons are as follows: HOW TO CONSTRUCT POLYGONS? Constructions are step by step processes used to create accurate geometric figures. To create a construction by hand, there are some few tools that you can use: 1. Compass: A device that allows you to create a circle with a given radius. Not only can compasses help you to create circles, but they can help you to copy distances. 2. Straightedge: Anything that allows you to produce a straight line. A straightedge should not be able to measure distances. An index card works well as a straghtedge. You can also use a ruler as a straightedge, as long as you only use it to draw straight lines and not to measure. 3. Paper: When a geometric figure is on a piece of paper, the paper itself can be folded in order to construct new lines. You can construct some regular polygons by hand if you remember the definitions and properties of these regular polygons.​</a>

_____ 9. Lightning and thunder are related events. Lightning is a sudden, violent flash of electricity that occurs between a cloud and the ground or between two clouds in the sky. A lightning bolt can be several miles long and can be straight or forked. It is very hot, with an average temperature of 34 000 degrees Celsius. This causes the air around the electric bolt to expand, producing lots of sound energy. It is this sound energy that we hear as thunder.
_____ 10. All things can be changed in two ways: chemically and physically.Physical changes are those that do not change the identity of the matter. For example, clay will bend or flatten if squeezed, but it will still be clay. Changing the shape of clay is a physical change and does not change the matter’s identity. Chemical changes turn the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties. For example, when paper is burnt, it becomes ash and will never be paper again.</h2><br />

                            16. Discover This lesson will deal with construction of regular polygona using compass and straightedge. VHAT IS A REGULAR POLYGONP Regular polygons have equal sides and equal interior angles. Some examples of regular polygons are as follows: HOW TO CONSTRUCT POLYGONS? Constructions are step by step processes used to create accurate geometric figures. To create a construction by hand, there are some few tools that you can use: 1. Compass: A device that allows you to create a circle with a given radius. Not only can compasses help you to create circles, but they can help you to copy distances. 2. Straightedge: Anything that allows you to produce a straight line. A straightedge should not be able to measure distances. An index card works well as a straghtedge. You can also use a ruler as a straightedge, as long as you only use it to draw straight lines and not to measure. 3. Paper: When a geometric figure is on a piece of paper, the paper itself can be folded in order to construct new lines. You can construct some regular polygons by hand if you remember the definitions and properties of these regular polygons.​</h2><br />

9. Lightning and thunder are related events. Lightning is a sudden, violent flash of electricity that occurs between a cloud and the ground or between two clouds in the sky. A lightning bolt can be several miles long and can be straight or forked. It is very hot, with an average temperature of 34 000 degrees Celsius. This causes the air around the electric bolt to expand, producing lots of sound energy. It is this sound energy that we hear as thunder.

Never assume the reader knows everything about your topic (even if it is covered in the reader’s field of study). For example, even though some of your instructors may teach criminology, they may have specialized in different areas from the one about which you are writing; they most likely have a strong understanding of the concepts but may not recall all the small details on the topic. If your instructor specialized in crime mapping and data analysis for example, he or she may not have a strong recollection of specific criminological theories related to other areas of study. Providing enough background information without being too detailed is a fine balance, but you always want to ensure you have no gaps in the information, so your reader will not have to guess your intention.
