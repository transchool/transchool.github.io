Data for discrete variables are often called nominal data or dichotomous data. <strong>For example: </strong>Dichotomous data 1 for the correct category and 0 for the wrong category.</p><p><strong>Discrete variables</strong> can be calculated in limited time.<strong> For example,</strong> you can count the change in your pocket.

It may take you a long time to calculate that last item, but the point is—it still counts.</p><p></p><p>A <strong>continuous variable</strong> is a variable whose data can be operated mathematically. Data for continuous variables is obtained from the measurement process so that the data can be in the form of fractions or in decimal form,<strong> for example, </strong>3.5 meters, value 7.5, average 7.0 and others. In general, continuous variables have values ​​which are the results of measurements. <strong>Examples of data</strong> for these variables are test scores, rankings, height, weight, length, distance. If grouped, data for continuous variables can be classified as ordinal data, interval data and ratio data.</p><p></p><p></p><p>For more information about discrete variables, click the link below.</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/18953121</p><p></p><p>#SPJ3</p><br />
