Your product allows users to play interactive role- playing games over the Internet. In the past 3 years, your company has gone from being a start- up enterprise with 10 employees and no revenues to a company with 250 employees and revenues of $60 million. It has been growing so rapidly that you have not had time to create a strategic plan, but now your board of directors is telling you that they want to see a plan, and they want it to drive decision making and resource allocation at the company. They want you to design a planning process that will have the following attributes: 1. It will be democratic, involving as many key employees as possible in the process. 2. It will help to build a sense of shared vision within the company about how to continue to grow rapidly. 3. It will lead to the generation of three to fivekey strategies for the company. 4. It will drive the formulation of detailed action plans, and these plans will be subsequently linked to the company’s annual operating budget. Required: Design a planning process to present to your board of directors. Think carefully about who should be included in this process. Be sure to outline the strengths and weaknesses of the approach you choose and be prepared to justify why your approach might be superior to alternative approaches. (​</a>

Use blocking strategies near the end of a point game, when the opportunities for scoring points diminish. 3. Set down doubles early. Do not get stuck with doubles. Lay them down early in the game or whenever you have the opportunity 4. Note your opponents weak suits. Take note of the tiles your opponent doesn't have. This will allow you to block them later in the game. 5. Evaluate the tiles in your hand and how they can change the board count 6. Set down your heavier tiles early. Play your heavier tiles early in the game so you won't be caught with a high score of points for your opponent 7. Always be aware of the board count. This is the total of all open ends on the layout 8. Control and manipulate the board count Push the board count up when you can set down scoring tiles, and down when you can't. 9. Work out your opponent's hand. Study the layout of already played tiles and the tiles in your own hand to guess what your opponents are holding in their hands. 10. Hold on to a variety of suits. Try to keep as many different suits as you can in your hand as long as you can​</a>

They want you to design a planning process that will have the following attributes: 1. It will be democratic, involving as many key employees as possible in the process. 2. It will help to build a sense of shared vision within the company about how to continue to grow rapidly. 3. It will lead to the generation of three to fivekey strategies for the company. 4. It will drive the formulation of detailed action plans, and these plans will be subsequently linked to the company’s annual operating budget. Required: Design a planning process to present to your board of directors. Think carefully about who should be included in this process. Be sure to outline the strengths and weaknesses of the approach you choose and be prepared to justify why your approach might be superior to alternative approaches. (​</h2><br />
