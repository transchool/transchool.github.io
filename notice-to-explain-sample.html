graph?
Let students notice the zigzag portion on the vertical axis (thermosphere layer). Let them explain why this is not a straight line.
A sample table of data about the Earths' atmosphere may look like this:
Estimated distance from the ground
Estimated temperature
Relationship between temperature and altitude
Events happening in that layer
Other information
Layer
Troposphere
Stratosphere
Mesosphere
Thermosphere
Exosphere
The students are now ready to study some global atmospheric phenomena.
What is the Greenhouse Effect?
The most abundant gases in the Earth's atmosphere are nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%). The remaining 1% is a mixture of carbon dioxide, water vapor, and ozone. These gases not only produce important weather features such as cloud and rain, but also have considerable influence on the overall climate of the Earth, through the greenhouse effect and global warming.
Activity

Does a greenhouse retain
or release heat?
In the Philippines, greenhouses are used by commercial plant growers or plant lovers. If there is a greenhouse in your locality, use it as a springboard for the lesson. Introduce the concept of greenhouses by asking students what they know about it.</a>
