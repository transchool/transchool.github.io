                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. It is very important for every fisher man to know the accurate weather forecast everyday for the reason of their safetyness, as we all know fisher mens/womens risk their lives in the middle of the sea just to get a dozens of fishes. Not knowing the accurate weather forecast evryday can be dangerous to them.</p><p></p><p>2. likewise with the fisher man, sailors also travels along the sea so the accurate weather forecast is very important for their safety. It also requires them to know the weather before they leave their stations.</p><p></p><p>3. Unlike the 2 group of people aforementioned, pilots travel in the air however the accuracy of weather is still important to them since it is dangerous to proceed a flight if there is a storm especially a typhoon when that happens the engine of the airplane will be put in a troubling situations hence the pilots and the airport company requires a clear or sunny days before departing the airport.</p><p></p><p>4. Housewives spent their time in their houses still the importance/accuracy of the weather is needed, mostly housewives takes care of their childrens taking them to their schools and doing the house chores like laundrying. If the weather forecast said it will be raing then they won't do the laundry or they will fetch their childrens at school since it will be raining, they also go to the market before it starts to rain.</p><p></p><p>5. To the students it is also important to them to know the daily weather forecast especially before going to their respective schools, if the trusted weather forecaster said it will be raining then the pupils would likely bring an umbrella and boots to avoid beinig drenched in the rain.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>that's all i could say, i hope it helps.
