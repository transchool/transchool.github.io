                        <strong>8 WAYS TO BECOME PROFESSIONAL IN THE WORKPLACE</strong><p>Acting like a professional really means doing what it takes to make others think of you as reliable, respectful, and competent. However it depends on where you work and the type of job you have, it may take various forms. But here are the common traits of being a Professional.</p><p><strong>1. Develop Competency</strong>: A workplace competency is a description of desired skill, attribute or behavior for a job which is used to measure an individual’s effectiveness. Usually workplace competency is judged from 2 aspects: Behavioral and Technical. Behavioral competencies are judged based on work confidentially, inspire others and submit monthly reports on time, while technical competencies are judged based on written communication skills, knowledge of procedures and ability to resolve conflict.</p><p><strong>2. Reliability:</strong> Reliability is essential to employee performance. A reliable employee is the one who always complete his/her work in time. </p><p><strong>3.

<p>
</p><p>I believe that the way you present yourself upon joining an organization sets up how most people will remember you. So,<strong> how an individual conducts oneself inside the company or business establishment during the immersion period is very important.</strong> <strong>Act professionally,</strong> you have to be there on time if not earlier.<strong> You must dress properly,</strong> clean well-ironed shirt and pants on top of a shiny pair of shoes impress many people. <strong> You have to show eagerness </strong>to learn. <strong>Be humble,</strong> not only will this virtue gain the friendship of good people inside the company, but it also has a positive effect within your own family. <strong>Don’t be afraid to ask questions,</strong> you can do this in a respectful way. <strong>Act naturally</strong>, faking around tends to flash slight hints which some people can detect. It is always a good idea to show who you really are in the beginning, and if you have no trouble doing that, your probably not such a bad person and any good organization can appreciate that, which is much better than working with a sleazy liar.  </p><p>

                            8. essay about how to conduct oneself inside the company or business establishment during work.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The way you conduct yourself at work can determine how others will treat you. Gaining respect to the people around you. Image is created from a number of elements, including the way you dress, the competency level of your work, showing up on time and how you treat the people around you. Loving the work you are doing. Make it a priority to be on time. When you arrive late for work or meetings, it gives your boss and co-workers the impression you don't care about your job and, if it affects them, it's like saying you don't value their time. Proper dressing. Whether you have to dress up for work or you can wear more casual clothes, your appearance should always be neat and clean.Be a good friend to people around you. Listen to their opinion for a wider idea. A true professional is willing to help his or her co-workers when they are overburdened or facing a challenge at work. He or she isn't afraid to share knowledge and opinions. Be a positive to encourage others. If you complain incessantly about your workplace, it will bring others down. Your boss certainly will not appreciate a drop in morale among his or her employees. That does not mean you shouldn't speak up about things you think are wrong. Honesty is important for you to gain the respect from your co-workers, keep your temper in check during challenging situations. If you can’t control your emotions, walk away until you’re in a calmer state of mind. Procrastination is a fact or life, but in the workplace it can lead to frustration between colleagues. Follow through on your responsibilities and your coworkers will view you as reliable. Conversely, show appreciation to coworkers who do the same. Independent of level or title, every person in your workplace deserves to be treated with respect. The more respected team members feel, the better you’ll be able to communicate and collaborate for optimal results.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>#HelpingHand</p><br />

                            16. What is the answer About essay on how to conduct oneself inside the company during the immersion period? </h2><br />
                        <p>An immersion is an important preparation for when you start to land a real job. <strong>How you conduct yourself during immersion</strong> is going to be utterly important since it will help you perform in your real employment.</p><p>Of course, you truly must leave a strong impression during your immersion period and here are some ways on <strong>how you to conduct yourself inside the company </strong>where you are immersed. </p><p>1. Be punctual - being on time shows that you are committed to what you are doing. Being late is the same as not minding your responsibilities and shows lack of respect for other people in the office.</p><p>2. Dress Appropriately – every company has a culture, and the dress requirement often depends on the culture of a company and that nature of your job. Creatives usually are fine to dress casually (not over casual like with flip flops, though), but front-liners often dress in a more corporate look. The common denominator, however, is looking neat and well-groomed. </p><p>3. Take initiative and help out, engage – do not wait for someone to tell you what to do; ask what you may do to help. Collaboration is imperative in every organization, and if you are not sharp enough to figure out where you are needed, then you will be thrown into the sidelines. Don’t think of yourself alone because when you help your colleagues and he or she accomplishes something, that reflects on everyone—your colleague, you, and your company most especially. </p><p>4. Listen – while you must of course share your knowledge, it is imperative that you listen too. Remember, you are new, and even if you excel so much in class, this is a new territory that you are entering, and the experts are the tenured ones. Make sure you listen to what they say because you are in the immersion to learn. </p><p>5. Stay away from the grapevine – office gossips are everywhere. People always have something to say about others. Avoid joining such conversations. You need a clean record, so you would not want to get on the bad side of anyone in the office. You don’t have to like everyone, but you have no right to ruin anyone even with words. </p><p>6. Mistakes are lessons – as the saying goes, ‘learn from your mistake’. Just because you made a mistake doesn’t mean you can’t do anything right. It happens in every workplace, so accept it and move on. Remember though that one mistake is fine, two of the same kind is acceptable, three of the same kind is too much. You must learn from your mistakes. </p><p>7. Control yourself – when the going gets tough, hold your horses and control your temper. Deadlines could be intense, and co-workers could be annoying, but that does not give you a license to lose your temper. Breathe in, breath out. Silently walk away if you must. </p><p>8. Observe Office Etiquette – do not text during a meeting; practice ‘clean as you go’ in the pantry and even in your station; make sure you observe office etiquette because this could affect how others see you. </p><p>9. Keep your word/Deadlines are sacred – while procrastination cannot be avoided at times, you must still honor your commitments. You must meet deadlines, and when you agree to do something, be sure to do it. </p><p>10. RESPECT – every person has a different personality, different cultural background, etc. Do not put your nose where it is not needed. Do not step into someone’s personal space uninvited. Show respect. This is the best you to survive any workplace.  </p><p>Clearly, h<strong>ow to conduct oneself inside the company establishment during the immersion period</strong> will help in how one would fare once employed in a real job.  </p><p>Read Related Topics

One of the newest curriculum's salient feature is the additional two years in the secondary level which consequently gave way to the division of the secondary level, now having the so-called Junior High School and Senior High School. The Junior high School constitutes the grades 7 to 10 and the Senior High School constitutes the additional two years, grades 11 and 12.</p><p>      With the emergence and implementation of the K-12 curriculum this only means, a new subjects will be offered especially in the Senior High School. One subject is the work immersion. A pre-requisite for graduation and a preparation for possible job application after graduation. For now, let us just focus first on the idea, to prepare for possible job application after graduation.</p><p>      Whether you agree or not, work immersion is a good platform to showcase your self, your skills, talents and everything that you can do. From that, you can be absorbed as a regular employee immediately after graduation in the same company you are deployed during the work immersion. So the question now, how to impress and or conduct yourself in the company where you will be assigned?</p><p>       First, before going to immersing yourself to the company, know first its background. It is from knowing the background of the company that you can be able to prepare yourself as you start working. Second, show good impression. It is very important to show good impression as early as the first day. Do not be late. Always smile. Greet everyone. Just express your enthusiasm working with your boss and with your co-workers. Third, look good. The magic words are, Dress to Impress. There might be misconception on this one. It does not mean that you have to dress up with clothes which are newly bought and or expensive, instead, you can wear simple, not costly yet elegant clothes, as what people say, simplicity is beauty. The only standard you have to meet is that, you have to look formal. Lastly, always express the vibe that you can be approached by your co-workers and or boss, and that you can be relied on. Made an impression that you can do your work effectively, efficiently, and independently.</p><p>       But one thing to remember, these things are just guides. More so, these are not constant. Some of these may not work for you or in the company where you will be assigned, therefore, you can still make adjustments depending on the situation you will find yourself in.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>#LearnWithBrainly</p><p></p><p>_________</p><p>Additional information can be extracted from these links below:</p><p>Objectives od work immersion</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/2643861</p><p>Importance of work immersion</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/2490649</p><p>Benefits of work immersion</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/2585584</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
