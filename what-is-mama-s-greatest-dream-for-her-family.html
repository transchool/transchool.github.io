                            1. what is mama's greatest dream for her family</h2><br />
                        From the story A Raisin in the Sun, what was Mama's greatest dream?
<p><strong>Mama's dream for her children and herself was simple. All she wanted was to relocate her family out of the projects, or the ghetto as it was called. She wanted to move into a proper house with a yard where she can start a garden and where her children could run freely.
</strong></p><p>
</p><p>What may seem like a simple dream is actually a dream for most African-Americans in the United States. Being a person of color living in the US is a struggle in itself, whether you are Black, Asian, or Latino. When you cannot afford to live in a better neighborhood, you are relegated to living in the projects where housing is so much cheaper. The problem is, some of these neighborhoods are also known to have higher crime rates than white suburban neighborhoods.
</p><p>
</p><p>What could be the reason for that? The simple reason is systemic discrimination which includes racism. Discrimination and racism is not just a strong negative feeling towards people who are different from yourself. Discrimination and racism run deep in society and has form systems that give little fighting chance to people who are different.
</p><p>
</p><p>Take African-Americans in the United States for example. Due to segregation, the children were not allowed to attend school with white children. White schools have better access to facilities and teachers who have better pay. As a result, African-American children were a bit behind compared to their white counterparts.
</p><p>
</p><p>Jobs were also limited to adults with no college degrees. And even people pf color who hold degrees are passed over in favor of Caucasians. Back then, people of color did not have civil rights which include protection against discrimination in the workplace. Black adults would often get laborious jobs with little pay. This would result in financial struggles and children who need to leave school early so that they can help with the family's needs.
</p><p>
</p><p>While it is not true for all African-American people, there are some who have resorted to dealing drugs or a life of crime. Another thing is that Black people are often targeted by the police. They are profiled right away as possible criminals even without proof just because of the color of their skin. It is not unusual for a black person to be pulled over by police in the highway while driving. Black people also tend to get longer or heavier prison sentences than white people and even for simple crimes like possession of marijuana, which is now legal in the United States.
</p><p>
</p><p>An African-American who leaves prison always struggles to find a job that can provide sufficiently. This becomes a problem because they are assigned parole officers who monitor them every week and if they do not get a job right away, their restrictions become heavier or they may end up in jail.
</p><p>
</p><p>As you can see, there are many reasons why it is such a struggle to be an African-American or a person of color these days. The cards are stacked against you and you may have to work three times harder than people with fairer skin. Even those who have graduated from college or live in suburban areas would still experience discrimination and microaggressions.
</p><p>
</p><p>This is why the <strong>Black Lives Matter Movement</strong> has never been more active and louder today. Even with civil rights, racism was never erased from society. People often mistake that by saying Black Lives Matter, they mean that Black is more important than any other skin color. That is completely wrong! <strong>What it actually means is that unless all skin color matters, black lives will not matter. All they want is to be treated with dignity and equality.
</strong></p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For people who are at a disadvantage, such as Mama and her family, a simple dream such as leaving the ghetto and having their own house may be hard to achieve.

The house is located in Clybourne Park where the neighbors are all whites. Though they are not truly aware of what will happen to them at their new home, they still manage to make the necessary adjustments by sticking one with another and be optimistic every step of the way.</p><p>The story is entitled A Raisin in the Sun since a raisin is dark colored while the sun is often visualized as very bright or luminous just like the whites. When the Youngers' transferred in at Clybourne Park, they are the only blacks that happened to live there. But because Mama, or the oldest female member of the family wanted her family to be comfortable with their new house, she tends to be the perfect example of optimism and flexibility with the entire members of the family. Eventually, the Youngers learn to oppose discrimination with defiance and strength. The story brilliantly demonstrates that the best way to deal with discrimination is to arise to it and reaffirm dignity in the face of it rather than allow it to pass unimpeded.</p><br /><br />

                        From the story A Raisin in the Sun, what was Mama's greatest dream?
<p><strong>Mama's dream for her children and herself was simple. All she wanted was to relocate her family out of the projects, or the ghetto as it was called. She wanted to move into a proper house with a yard where she can start a garden and where her children could run freely.

</p><p>What may seem like a simple dream is actually a dream for most African-Americans in the United States. Being a person of color living in the US is a struggle in itself, whether you are Black, Asian, or Latino.

                        From the story A Raisin in the Sun, what was Mama's greatest dream?
<p><strong>Mama's dream for her children and herself was simple. All she wanted was to relocate her family out of the projects, or the ghetto as it was called. She wanted to move into a proper house with a yard where she can start a garden and where her children could run freely.
</strong></p><p>
</p><p>What may seem like a simple dream is actually a dream for most African-Americans in the United States. Being a person of color living in the US is a struggle in itself, whether you are Black, Asian, or Latino. When you cannot afford to live in a better neighborhood, you are relegated to living in the projects where housing is so much cheaper. The problem is, some of these neighborhoods are also known to have higher crime rates than white suburban neighborhoods.
</p><p>
</p><p>What could be the reason for that? The simple reason is systemic discrimination which includes racism. Discrimination and racism is not just a strong negative feeling towards people who are different from yourself. Discrimination and racism run deep in society and has form systems that give little fighting chance to people who are different.
</p><p>
</p><p>Take African-Americans in the United States for example. Due to segregation, the children were not allowed to attend school with white children. White schools have better access to facilities and teachers who have better pay. As a result, African-American children were a bit behind compared to their white counterparts.
</p><p>
</p><p>Jobs were also limited to adults with no college degrees. And even people pf color who hold degrees are passed over in favor of Caucasians. Back then, people of color did not have civil rights which include protection against discrimination in the workplace. Black adults would often get laborious jobs with little pay. This would result in financial struggles and children who need to leave school early so that they can help with the family's needs.
</p><p>
</p><p>While it is not true for all African-American people, there are some who have resorted to dealing drugs or a life of crime. Another thing is that Black people are often targeted by the police. They are profiled right away as possible criminals even without proof just because of the color of their skin. It is not unusual for a black person to be pulled over by police in the highway while driving. Black people also tend to get longer or heavier prison sentences than white people and even for simple crimes like possession of marijuana, which is now legal in the United States.
</p><p>
</p><p>An African-American who leaves prison always struggles to find a job that can provide sufficiently. This becomes a problem because they are assigned parole officers who monitor them every week and if they do not get a job right away, their restrictions become heavier or they may end up in jail.
</p><p>
</p><p>As you can see, there are many reasons why it is such a struggle to be an African-American or a person of color these days. The cards are stacked against you and you may have to work three times harder than people with fairer skin. Even those who have graduated from college or live in suburban areas would still experience discrimination and microaggressions.
</p><p>
</p><p>This is why the <strong>Black Lives Matter Movement</strong> has never been more active and louder today. Even with civil rights, racism was never erased from society. People often mistake that by saying Black Lives Matter, they mean that Black is more important than any other skin color. That is completely wrong! <strong>What it actually means is that unless all skin color matters, black lives will not matter. All they want is to be treated with dignity and equality.

                        From the story A Raisin in the Sun, what was Mama's greatest dream?
<p><strong>Mama's dream for her children and herself was simple. All she wanted was to relocate her family out of the projects, or the ghetto as it was called. She wanted to move into a proper house with a yard where she can start a garden and where her children could run freely.
</strong></p><p>
</p><p>What may seem like a simple dream is actually a dream for most African-Americans in the United States. Being a person of color living in the US is a struggle in itself, whether you are Black, Asian, or Latino. When you cannot afford to live in a better neighborhood, you are relegated to living in the projects where housing is so much cheaper. The problem is, some of these neighborhoods are also known to have higher crime rates than white suburban neighborhoods.
</p><p>
</p><p>What could be the reason for that? The simple reason is systemic discrimination which includes racism. Discrimination and racism is not just a strong negative feeling towards people who are different from yourself. Discrimination and racism run deep in society and has form systems that give little fighting chance to people who are different.
</p><p>
</p><p>Take African-Americans in the United States for example. Due to segregation, the children were not allowed to attend school with white children. White schools have better access to facilities and teachers who have better pay. As a result, African-American children were a bit behind compared to their white counterparts.
</p><p>
</p><p>Jobs were also limited to adults with no college degrees. And even people pf color who hold degrees are passed over in favor of Caucasians. Back then, people of color did not have civil rights which include protection against discrimination in the workplace. Black adults would often get laborious jobs with little pay. This would result in financial struggles and children who need to leave school early so that they can help with the family's needs.
</p><p>
</p><p>While it is not true for all African-American people, there are some who have resorted to dealing drugs or a life of crime. Another thing is that Black people are often targeted by the police. They are profiled right away as possible criminals even without proof just because of the color of their skin. It is not unusual for a black person to be pulled over by police in the highway while driving. Black people also tend to get longer or heavier prison sentences than white people and even for simple crimes like possession of marijuana, which is now legal in the United States.
</p><p>
</p><p>An African-American who leaves prison always struggles to find a job that can provide sufficiently. This becomes a problem because they are assigned parole officers who monitor them every week and if they do not get a job right away, their restrictions become heavier or they may end up in jail.
</p><p>
</p><p>As you can see, there are many reasons why it is such a struggle to be an African-American or a person of color these days. The cards are stacked against you and you may have to work three times harder than people with fairer skin. Even those who have graduated from college or live in suburban areas would still experience discrimination and microaggressions.
</p><p>
</p><p>This is why the <strong>Black Lives Matter Movement</strong> has never been more active and louder today. Even with civil rights, racism was never erased from society. People often mistake that by saying Black Lives Matter, they mean that Black is more important than any other skin color. That is completely wrong! <strong>What it actually means is that unless all skin color matters, black lives will not matter. All they want is to be treated with dignity and equality.
</strong></p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For people who are at a disadvantage, such as Mama and her family, a simple dream such as leaving the ghetto and having their own house may be hard to achieve.
