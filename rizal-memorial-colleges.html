Becouse he was a frail sickly, and undersized child, he was given the tenderest care by his parent. His father built a little nipa cottage in the garden for him to play in the day time.</p><p>Rizal's boyhood is typical, similar to other kids his age. From telling stories of his crushes to experiencing beatings, Rizal was like any other boy. Except for the fact that he was really a bright young kid. Jose Rizal's education started at home with his mom and aunt as his first teachers.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>   " EARLIEST CHILDHOOD MEMORIES"                    OF JOSE RIZAL<p>THE FIRST MEMORY OF RIZAL IN HIS INFANCY WAS HIS HAPPY DAYS IN THE FAMILY GARDEN.</p><p></p><p>BECAUSE HE WAS FRAIL,SICKLY, AND UNDER SIZED  CHILD, HE WAS GIVEN THE MOST TENDER CARE BY HIS PARENTS</p><p></p><p>BRAINLIEST </p><br />

                            4. main theme of the poem memories of my town by rizal​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Rizal wrote this poem in 1876, when he was 15 years old.</p><p>When I recall the days</p><p>That saw my childhood of yore</p><p>Beside the verdant shore</p><p>Of a murmuring lagoon;</p><p>When I remember the sighs</p><p>Of the breeze that on my brow</p><p>Sweet and caressing did blow</p><p>With coolness full of delight;</p><p></p><p>When I look at the lily white</p><p>Fills up with air violent</p><p>And the stormy element</p><p>On the sand doth meekly sleep;</p><p>When sweet 'toxicating scent</p><p>From the flowers I inhale</p><p>Which at the dawn they exhale</p><p>When at us it begins to peep;</p><p></p><p>In these first two stanzas, Rizal uses a literary device intended to prolong suspense. Every fifth line begins with the word “When,” which indicates that there is a resulting effect following the clause that tails it. These series of “when” lines look back to his childhood and the colorful encounter with nature which was associated with those years.</p><p></p><p>I sadly recall your face,</p><p>Oh precious infancy,</p><p>That a mother lovingly</p><p>Did succeed to embellish.</p><p>I remember a simple town;</p><p>My cradle, joy and boon,</p><p>Beside the cool lagoon</p><p>The seat of all my wish.</p><p></p><p>Whose face does he recall? It is the face of infancy, his infancy, his innocence. He remembers it with sadness because he misses it and longs for it – the simple life in a simple town – misses his mother, who lavished him with love and untainted joy.</p><p></p><p>Oh, yes! With uncertain pace</p><p>I trod your forest lands,</p><p>And on your river banks</p><p>A pleasant fun I found;</p><p>At your rustic temple I prayed</p><p>With a little boy's simple faith</p><p>And your aura's flawless breath</p><p>Filled my heart with joy profound.</p><p></p><p>Here we see a more candid side of the young Rizal, unstudied as he walks through forest lands and river banks, praying with a pure, untainted faith in the old churches of his hometown. That he does not leave out prayer indicates his strong Catholic upbringing.</p><p></p><p>Saw I God in the grandeur</p><p>Of your woods which for centuries stand;</p><p>Never did I understand</p><p>In your bosom what sorrows were;</p><p>While I gazed on your azure sky</p><p>Neither love nor tenderness</p><p>Failed me, 'cause my happiness</p><p>In the heart of nature rests there.</p><p></p><p>He remembers nothing but pure joy during those moments of his childhood; during those days he knew nothing of grief and pain, as evidenced in the lines, “Never did I understand in your bosom what sorrows were.”  The last three lines can be translated in plainer English as, “Neither love nor tenderness failed me, because my happiness rests there in the heart of nature.”</p><p></p><p>Tender childhood, beautiful town,</p><p>Rich fountain of happiness,</p><p>Of harmonious melodies,</p><p>That drive away my sorrow!</p><p>Return thee to my heart,</p><p>Bring back my gentle hours</p><p>As do the birds when the flow'rs</p><p>Would again begin to blow!</p><p></p><p>This stanza is the highest emotional point of the entire poem. This is also the first time the listener hears him in a tone of exclamation. It is here that Rizal expresses his longing for those years to come back and stay with him.</p><p></p><p>But, alas, adieu! E'er watch</p><p>For your peace, joy and repose,</p><p>Genius of good who kindly dispose</p><p>Of his blessings with amour;</p><p>It's for thee my fervent pray'rs,</p><p>It's for thee my constant desire</p><p>Knowledge ever to acquire</p><p>And may God keep your candour!</p><p></p><p>In this conclusion, Rizal bids his town and his childhood memories farewell, and prays that his town remains as vibrant and full of hope and happiness as he remembers it.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Jose P.

                            18. In what school did Rizal wnroll to pursue his college education?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Primary Education</strong></p><p></p><p>Rizal first attended an all-boys private school in Biñan, Laguna from 1870 to 1871 under Maestro Justiniano Aquino Cruz. The Maestro’s nipa hut served as the school where Rizal mastered Latin and learned Spanish. Rizal’s great interest in the art made him a frequent visitor of the painter Juancho whose house was just near the school. The old painter gave Rizal free lessons in drawing and painting, and was impressed with the artistry of the young Pepe.</p><p></p><p><strong>Secondary Education</strong></p><p></p><p>Rizal was a fast learner, and had excelled under Maestro Justiniano. It was the Maestro who suggested to Jose’s parents that he be sent to Manila to pursue higher education. On June 10, 1872, four months after the execution of Gomburza, accompanied by Paciano, Jose went to Manila and took an entrance examination at the Colegio de San Juan de Letran. But his father wanted a Jesuit college instead, and so Rizal tried at the Ateneo Municipal. Father Magin Ferrando, the college registrar, refused to admit Rizal for being overly late for the registration, and being sickly and too short for his age. Through the intercession of Manuel Xerez Burgos, Jose Burgos’ nephew, he was admitted at the Ateneo.</p><p></p><p>It was in Ateneo Municipal where the young Pepe first make used of the surname Rizal (from the Spanish word ricial, meaning green field or pasture) which was uniquely chosen by Don Francisco to avoid suspicions from the Spanish authorities of their relationship with the martyr, Burgos. Rizal was an excellent student and had garnered high scholastic records in all subjects. On March 23, 1877, the 15-year old Rizal received his Bachelor of Arts diploma (equivalent to present-day high school diploma), and was among the nine sobresaliente or outstanding students of their class.</p><p></p><p><strong>Tertiary Education</strong><strong> </strong><strong>(</strong>College<strong>)</strong></p><p></p><p>After finishing his studies in Ateneo, Rizal aimed to pursue a degree in a univerity. However, Doña Teodora had a premonition that Pepe’s life will be imperiled once he acquired too much knowledge. After a long discussion with family mebers, Don Francisco and Paciano finally convinced Doña Teodora to permit Rizal to enroll in a university. In April 1877, Rizal matriculated in the University of Santo Tomas and took Philosophy and Letters (1877-88) primarily because his father liked it, and he was still undecided on what career path to take. Rizal also took a surveying course in Ateneo. The following year, he shifted to Medicine which gave him grades that he found less remarkable than those he received from Ateneo. In UST, Rizal saw and experienced the rampant discrimination of Spaniards to Filipinos. One of which was from a Dominican priest who swore that he will never ever pass Rizal in any subject under him (although records show that Rizal did not receive any failing grades). This made Rizal decide to leave UST and pursue his medical course in Spain.</p><p></p><p><strong>Education Abroad</strong></p><p></p><p>Without prior consent from his parents and with the financial support from Paciano, Rizal traveled alone to Madrid, Spain on May 3, 1882 via the steamer, Salvadora, sailing to Singapore. On November 3, he enrolled in two courses – Medicine, and Philosophy and Letters – at the Universidad Central de Madrid. He also took lessons in painting and sculpture, and studied French, German and English languages under a private instructor in the Academy of San Carlos. He continued his passion for sports, practicing fencing and shooting in the Hall of Arms of Sanz y Carbonell in Madrid, as well.</p><p></p><p>On June 21, 1884, Jose Rizal completed his medical course and was awarded the degree of Licentiate in Medicine by the Universidad Central de Madrid. By the end of school year 1884-1885, he acquired the degree of Doctor of Medicine and received his degree of Licentiate in Philosophy and Letters on June 19, 1885 as sobresaliente.</p><p></p><p><strong>Early Education in Calamba and Biñan</strong></p><p></p><p>Rizal had his early education in Calamba and Biñan. It was a typical schooling that a son of an ilustrado family received during his time, characterized by the four R’s- reading, writing, arithmetic, and religion. Instruction was rigid and strict. Knowledge was forced into the minds of the pupils by means of the tedious memory method aided by the teacher’s whip. Despite the defects of the Spanish system of elementary education, Rizal was able to acquire the necessary instruction preparatory for college work in Manila. It may be said that Rizal, who was born a physical weakling, rose to become an intellectual giant not because of, but rather in spite of, the outmoded and backward system of instruction obtaining in the Philippines during the last decades of Spanish regime.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana makatulong</p><br />

                        <p>The life, works, and writings of Dr. Jose Rizal are included in the college curriculum of all Philippine colleges <strong>with the explicit purpose of instilling nationalism in the Filipino student. </strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>If you ever set foot in college, chances are you’ve taken a whole class dedicated to Dr. Jose Rizal and his works. If not, then I’ll tell you what those classes usually involved. The class curriculum studies all the thinkpieces and literature Dr. Jose Rizal wrote in the topic of Filipino culture. These materials include: The Women of Malolos, El Filibusterismo, and Noli me Tangere.</p><p></p><p>The reason why this subject is included is because of <strong>Claro M. Recto. </strong>Recto fought for a bill to be passed requiring the subject of Rizal in colleges in the 1950s because he thought it was a way for the Philippines to revitalize the feeling of nationalism. He did it with strong opposition from the Catholic Church.</p><p></p><p>In Rizal’s writing the Catholic Church is often unapologetically criticized. In his books Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo we can infer that Rizal thought of the Catholic Church institutions as filled with hypocrites and an oppressing force in the liberation and progress of the Filipino society. As a matter of fact, when Antonio Morga, a Spanish lieutenant-general, thought of the Catholic Church as a saving institution and therefore making the Spanish colonization a holy duty Rizal refuted it by expressing his belief that Christianity is a colonizing tool.</p><p></p><p>By studying the life and works of Rizal, Recto hoped that the Filipino student can awaken in them the feeling of citizenship duties, discipline, loyalty to the nation, and above all cultivate a critical mind like Rizal have.</p><p></p><p>Just like Rizal, he hoped that we feel even a little bit of the love that Rizal had for the nation that was palpable in his writing. Though this purpose is noble, I hoped that the Filipino student is not blind to Rizal’s own biases and flaws in thinking. And rather than these biases and flaws being a proof that Rizal’s ideas are useless it is instead a further aid in reconstructing his life and the kind of era he lived in.</p><p></p><p>For more information on Rizal’s writings: https://brainly.ph/question/6181618</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><p></p><br />

During this time, even the Dominican friars were discriminating him. It was the very first time in which Rizal witnessed the friars doing something like that. From that day onwards, he saw by his heart that the ones that he treated as the good ones, are the ones who would trigger the present condition.
