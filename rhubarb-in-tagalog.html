                                            1. On rainy afternoons, embroidering with a group of friends on the begonia porch, she would lose the thread of the conversation and a tear of nostalgia would salt her palate when she saw the strips of damp carth and the piles of mud that the earthworms had pushed up in the garden. Those secret tastes, defeated in the past by oranges and rhubarb, broke out into an irrepressible urge when she began to weep. She went back to cating earth. The first time she did it almost out of curiosity, sure that the bad taste would be the best cure for the temptation. And, in fact, she could not bear the earth in her mouth. But she persevered, overcome by the growing anxiety, and little by little she was getting back her ancestral appetite, the taste of primary minerals, the unbridled satisfaction of what was the original food. (One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel García Márquez) 2. In the period of which we speak, there reigned in the cities a stench barely conceivable to us modern men and women. The streets stank of manure, the courtyards of urine, the stairwells stank of moldering wood and rat droppings, the kitchens of spoiled cabbage and mutton fat; the unaired parlors stank of stale dust, the bedrooms of greasy sheets, damp featherbeds, and the pungently sweet aroma of chamber pots. The stench of sulfur rose from the chimneys, the stench of caustic lyes from the tanneries, and from the slaughterhouses came the stench of congealed blood. People stank of sweat and unwashed clothes; from their mouths came the stench of rotting teeth, from their bellies that of onions, and from their bodies, if they were no longer very young, came the stench of rancid cheese and sour milk and tumorous disease. (Perfume: The Story of a Murderer by Patrick Suskind) 3. She ran her hand across the dark, concrete wall. It was cold as ice. When she came to the middle of the room, she felt a thick, slimy substance actively oozing down the wall.​</a>

Ang Kuwento ng Paglikhang Zoroastrian
(Mitolohiya mula sa Persia)
Muling isinalaysay sa Ingles ni Rebecca Cann
Salin sa Filipino ni Daniel A. De Guzman
Sa simula, walang anomang bagay sa daigdig na nabubuhay kundi si Ahura Mazda, ang paham na Panginoon na nananahan sa walang hanggang liwanag. Gayundin, si Ahriman, ang masamang espiritu na nabubuhay sa kadiliman. Sa kanilang pagitan ay ang kawalan.
Isang araw, nagpasya si Ahura Mazda na simulan ang kaniyang paglikha. Una, nilikha niya ang kalangitan na gawa sa metal – makinis at makintab. Pangalawa, ang malinis na tubig. Pangatlo, nilikha niya ang mundong patag, walang bundok at lambak. Pang-apat, lumikha siya ng mahahalimuyak na bulaklak na walang matitigas na tinik o balat. Ikalimang nilikha niya ay maliliit at malalaking hayop. Matapos ay nilikha niya si Gayomard – ang unang tao. Siya ay matalino, matangkad, at magandang lalaki. Panghuli, lumikha siya ng apoy at ipinagkaloob sa lahat ng kaniyang nilalang. Ginawa niya ito upang magamit ng sangkatauhan sa pagluluto ng pagkain at maging panlaban sa lamig.
Sa isang pagkakataon, sumilip ang masamang espiritu sa napakagandang likha ng paham na Panginoon. Tinawag siya ni Ahura Mazda at nagsabing “Masamang espiritu! Pagsilbihan mo at papurihan ang aking mga likha, nang sa gayon ay maging imortal ka. Umangal ang masamang espiritu, “Bakit ko pagsisilbihan ang mga likha mo? Bakit ko ito papupurihan? Mas makapangyarihan ako! Pupuksain kita at wawasakin ang lahat ng iyong mga likha.” Matapos nito ay bumalik si Ahriman sa kaniyang kinatatahanang kadiliman upang lumikha ng mga demonyo, mangkukulam, at mga halimaw na lulusob sa walang hanggang liwanag.
Alam ng paham na Panginoon ang lahat ng bagay. Alam niyang gumagawa ng mga demonyo ang masamang espiritu upang sirain ang kaniyang magagandang likha. Alam rin niyang magkakaroon ng isang malaking digmaan laban sa kadiliman. Dahil dito, binuo niya ang anim na Espiritu – Ang mga Banal na Imortal, upang bantayan ang kaniyang mga likha laban sa Walang Hanggang Kadiliman. Binuo ng paham na Panginoon ang mga Banal na Imortal mula sa kaniyang sariling kaluluwa. Taglay ng bawat isa ang kaniyang katangian. Ang unang Banal na Imortal ay si Khashathra, ang Kapangyarihan ng Katuwiran, na nagsilbing tagabantay ng kalangitan. Sumunod na nilikha ng paham na Panginoon si Haurvatat, ang Kapayapaan at Kawastuhan. Siya ang naging tagapangalaga ng katubigan. Ang pangatlong nilikha ay si Spenta Armaiti, ang Banal na Debosyon na tagapagbantay ng daigdig. Si Ameretat, ang Imortal, ang naging tagapangalaga ng mga halaman. Si Vohu Mana, Ang Mabuting Pag-iisip ay piniling pangalagaan ang mga hayop. At si Asha Vahista, ang Hustisya, ang naging tagapagbantay ng apoy. Panghuli, itinalaga ng paham na Panginoon ang kaniyang sarili bilang tagapangalaga ng sangkatauhan.
Nakita ni Ahriman ang mga Banal na Imortal at nagngangalit na sinabi, “Ahura Mazda, pupuksain kita at ang iyong mga likha. Hindi ka kailanman magwawagi!” Isa-isang sinalakay ni Ahriman kasama ng kaniyang mga likhang demonyo ang mga likha ng Paham na Panginoon. Sinubukan nilang wasakin ang katubigan ngunit tanging katabangan lamang ang naidulot nila rito. Sinubukan niyang sirain ang kalupaan ngunit tanging kabundukan at lambak lamang ang kanilang nagawa. Sinubukan nilang lantahin ang mga halaman ngunit tanging mga tinik lamang ang tumubo rito. Nagdulot ang mga masasamang espiritu ni Ahriman ng kalungkutan laban sa kaligayahan, sakit laban sa kaginhawahan, polusyon laban sa kalinisan, at kamatayan laban sa buhay. Sinalakay nila si Gayomard. Ang unang tao ay nagkasakit at namatay.
Inakala ni Ahriman na nawasak na niya ang sangkatauhan at nagwagi laban sa liwanag. Ngunit siya ay mangmang at hangal. Nang mamatay si Gayomard, may umusbong na halamang Rhubarb mula sa mga buto niya. Makalipas ang apat na dekada, isang lalaki at babae na nagngangalang Mashya at Mashyana ang nabuhay mula sa halamang ito. Nangako sina Mashya at Mashyana sa paham na Panginoon na makikiisa sila sa pakikipaglaban kay Ahriman. Nanganak si Mashyana ng labinlimang kambal at ang bawat pares ay nagkalat sa buong mundo upang pagsimulan ng mga salinlahi. Naging tagasunod ng paham na Panginoon ang bawat isa sa pamamagitan ng mabuting pag-iisip, mabuting gawi, at mabuting pananalita.</a>

(One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel García Márquez) 2.	My little horse must think it queer To stop without a farmhouse near Between the woods and frozen lake The darkest evening of the year. He gives his harness bells a shake To ask if there is some mistake. The only other sound’s the sweep Of easy wind and downy flake. (“Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening” by Robert Frost) 3.	Outside, even through the shut window-pane, the world looked cold. Down in the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into spirals, and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue, there seemed to be no colour in anything, except the posters that were plastered everywhere. The black mustachioed face gazed down from every commanding corner. There was one on the house-front immediately opposite. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption said, while the dark eyes looked deep into Winston’s own. Down at street level another poster, torn at one corner, flapped fitfully in the wind, alternately covering and uncovering the single word INGSOC. In the far distance a helicopter skimmed down between the roofs, hovered for an instant like a bluebottle, and darted away again with a curving flight. (1984 by George Orwell) 4.	In the period of which we speak, there reigned in the cities a stench barely conceivable to us modern men and women. The streets stank of manure, the courtyards of urine, the stairwells stank of moldering wood and rat droppings, the kitchens of spoiled cabbage and mutton fat; the unaired parlors stank of stale dust, the bedrooms of greasy sheets, damp featherbeds, and the pungently sweet aroma of chamber pots. The stench of sulfur rose from the chimneys, the stench of caustic lyes from the tanneries, and from the slaughterhouses came the stench of congealed blood. People stank of sweat and unwashed clothes; from their mouths came the stench of rotting teeth, from their bellies that of onions, and from their bodies, if they were no longer very young, came the stench of rancid cheese and sour milk and tumorous disease. (Perfume: The Story of a Murderer by Patrick Suskind) 5.	She ran her hand across the dark, concrete wall. It was cold as ice. When she came to the middle of the room, she felt a thick, slimy substance actively oozing down the wall. ​</a>

People stank of sweat and unwashed clothes; from their mouths came the stench of rotting teeth, from their bellies that of onions, and from their bodies, if they were no longer very young, came the stench of rancid cheese and sour milk and tumorous disease.

Ang Kuwento ng Paglikhang Zoroastrian
(Mitolohiya mula sa Persia)
Muling isinalaysay sa Ingles ni Rebecca Cann
Salin sa Filipino ni Daniel A. De Guzman
Sa simula, walang anomang bagay sa daigdig na nabubuhay kundi si Ahura Mazda, ang paham na Panginoon na nananahan sa walang hanggang liwanag. Gayundin, si Ahriman, ang masamang espiritu na nabubuhay sa kadiliman. Sa kanilang pagitan ay ang kawalan.
Isang araw, nagpasya si Ahura Mazda na simulan ang kaniyang paglikha. Una, nilikha niya ang kalangitan na gawa sa metal – makinis at makintab. Pangalawa, ang malinis na tubig. Pangatlo, nilikha niya ang mundong patag, walang bundok at lambak. Pang-apat, lumikha siya ng mahahalimuyak na bulaklak na walang matitigas na tinik o balat. Ikalimang nilikha niya ay maliliit at malalaking hayop. Matapos ay nilikha niya si Gayomard – ang unang tao. Siya ay matalino, matangkad, at magandang lalaki. Panghuli, lumikha siya ng apoy at ipinagkaloob sa lahat ng kaniyang nilalang. Ginawa niya ito upang magamit ng sangkatauhan sa pagluluto ng pagkain at maging panlaban sa lamig.
Sa isang pagkakataon, sumilip ang masamang espiritu sa napakagandang likha ng paham na Panginoon. Tinawag siya ni Ahura Mazda at nagsabing “Masamang espiritu! Pagsilbihan mo at papurihan ang aking mga likha, nang sa gayon ay maging imortal ka. Umangal ang masamang espiritu, “Bakit ko pagsisilbihan ang mga likha mo? Bakit ko ito papupurihan? Mas makapangyarihan ako! Pupuksain kita at wawasakin ang lahat ng iyong mga likha.” Matapos nito ay bumalik si Ahriman sa kaniyang kinatatahanang kadiliman upang lumikha ng mga demonyo, mangkukulam, at mga halimaw na lulusob sa walang hanggang liwanag.
Alam ng paham na Panginoon ang lahat ng bagay. Alam niyang gumagawa ng mga demonyo ang masamang espiritu upang sirain ang kaniyang magagandang likha. Alam rin niyang magkakaroon ng isang malaking digmaan laban sa kadiliman. Dahil dito, binuo niya ang anim na Espiritu – Ang mga Banal na Imortal, upang bantayan ang kaniyang mga likha laban sa Walang Hanggang Kadiliman. Binuo ng paham na Panginoon ang mga Banal na Imortal mula sa kaniyang sariling kaluluwa. Taglay ng bawat isa ang kaniyang katangian. Ang unang Banal na Imortal ay si Khashathra, ang Kapangyarihan ng Katuwiran, na nagsilbing tagabantay ng kalangitan. Sumunod na nilikha ng paham na Panginoon si Haurvatat, ang Kapayapaan at Kawastuhan. Siya ang naging tagapangalaga ng katubigan. Ang pangatlong nilikha ay si Spenta Armaiti, ang Banal na Debosyon na tagapagbantay ng daigdig. Si Ameretat, ang Imortal, ang naging tagapangalaga ng mga halaman. Si Vohu Mana, Ang Mabuting Pag-iisip ay piniling pangalagaan ang mga hayop. At si Asha Vahista, ang Hustisya, ang naging tagapagbantay ng apoy. Panghuli, itinalaga ng paham na Panginoon ang kaniyang sarili bilang tagapangalaga ng sangkatauhan.
Nakita ni Ahriman ang mga Banal na Imortal at nagngangalit na sinabi, “Ahura Mazda, pupuksain kita at ang iyong mga likha. Hindi ka kailanman magwawagi!” Isa-isang sinalakay ni Ahriman kasama ng kaniyang mga likhang demonyo ang mga likha ng Paham na Panginoon. Sinubukan nilang wasakin ang katubigan ngunit tanging katabangan lamang ang naidulot nila rito. Sinubukan niyang sirain ang kalupaan ngunit tanging kabundukan at lambak lamang ang kanilang nagawa. Sinubukan nilang lantahin ang mga halaman ngunit tanging mga tinik lamang ang tumubo rito. Nagdulot ang mga masasamang espiritu ni Ahriman ng kalungkutan laban sa kaligayahan, sakit laban sa kaginhawahan, polusyon laban sa kalinisan, at kamatayan laban sa buhay. Sinalakay nila si Gayomard. Ang unang tao ay nagkasakit at namatay.
Inakala ni Ahriman na nawasak na niya ang sangkatauhan at nagwagi laban sa liwanag. Ngunit siya ay mangmang at hangal. Nang mamatay si Gayomard, may umusbong na halamang Rhubarb mula sa mga buto niya. Makalipas ang apat na dekada, isang lalaki at babae na nagngangalang Mashya at Mashyana ang nabuhay mula sa halamang ito. Nangako sina Mashya at Mashyana sa paham na Panginoon na makikiisa sila sa pakikipaglaban kay Ahriman. Nanganak si Mashyana ng labinlimang kambal at ang bawat pares ay nagkalat sa buong mundo upang pagsimulan ng mga salinlahi. Naging tagasunod ng paham na Panginoon ang bawat isa sa pamamagitan ng mabuting pag-iisip, mabuting gawi, at mabuting pananalita.</h2><br />
                        <p>Ang kuwentong Zoroastrian ay nagpapakita ng paglikha ng mundo mula sa paniniwala ng mga sinaunang Persiano. Ito ay nagpapakita ng magandang simula ng mundo na nilikha ni Ahura Mazda, ang Panginoon na nasa liwanag at ng masamang espiritu na si Ahriman na nabubuhay sa kadiliman. Nagpakita ito ng labanan ng liwanag at kadiliman, na pinapakita sa pamamagitan ng paglikha ng mga magagandang bagay sa mundo at ng mga masasamang bagay na sumisira sa mga ito. Nagpapakita rin ito ng kahalagahan ng pagiging mabuting tagapamahala sa mundo sa pamamagitan ng paglikha ng anim na Banal na Imortal na nagbantay at nag-alaga ng bawat likha ng Paham na Panginoon laban sa kadiliman. Sa kabuuan, nagbibigay ito ng aral na ang mabuti ay magtatagumpay sa huli at na ang mabuting pagpapamahala sa mundo ay mahalaga upang mapanatili ang kalinisan at kaligtasan nito.</p><p></p><br />

He gives his harness bells a shake To ask if there is some mistake. The only other sound’s the sweep Of easy wind and downy flake. (“Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening” by Robert Frost) 3.	Outside, even through the shut window-pane, the world looked cold. Down in the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into spirals, and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue, there seemed to be no colour in anything, except the posters that were plastered everywhere. The black mustachioed face gazed down from every commanding corner. There was one on the house-front immediately opposite. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption said, while the dark eyes looked deep into Winston’s own. Down at street level another poster, torn at one corner, flapped fitfully in the wind, alternately covering and uncovering the single word INGSOC. In the far distance a helicopter skimmed down between the roofs, hovered for an instant like a bluebottle, and darted away again with a curving flight. (1984 by George Orwell) 4.	In the period of which we speak, there reigned in the cities a stench barely conceivable to us modern men and women. The streets stank of manure, the courtyards of urine, the stairwells stank of moldering wood and rat droppings, the kitchens of spoiled cabbage and mutton fat; the unaired parlors stank of stale dust, the bedrooms of greasy sheets, damp featherbeds, and the pungently sweet aroma of chamber pots. The stench of sulfur rose from the chimneys, the stench of caustic lyes from the tanneries, and from the slaughterhouses came the stench of congealed blood. People stank of sweat and unwashed clothes; from their mouths came the stench of rotting teeth, from their bellies that of onions, and from their bodies, if they were no longer very young, came the stench of rancid cheese and sour milk and tumorous disease.
