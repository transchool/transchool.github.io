The Bear and the Two Travelers
TWO MEN were traveling together, when a Bear suddenly met them on their path. One of them climbed up quickly into a tree and concealed himself in the branches. The other, seeing that he must be attacked, fell flat on the ground, and when the Bear came up and felt him with his snout, and smelt him all over, he held his breath, and feigned the appearance of death as much as he could. The Bear soon left him, for it said he will not touch a dead body. When he was quite gone, the other Traveler descended from the tree, and jocularly inquired of his friend what it was the Bear had whispered in his ear. “He gave me this advice,” his companion replied. “Never travel with a friend who deserts you at the approach of danger.”</a>

Across the centuries the memory comes rushing back to me: of brown-skinned men putting out to sea in ships that were as frail as their hearts were stout. Over the sea I see them come, borne upon the billowing wave and the whistling wind, carried upon the mighty swell of hope–hope in the free abundance of new land that was to be their home and their children’s forever.​</a>

                                            All the girls stood grouped together at one side of the doors, the men at the other, and the chaperones in dark dresses, smiling rather foolishly, walked with little careful steps over the polished floor towards the stage.     "This is my little country cousin Leila. Be nice to her. Find her partners; she's under my wing," said Meg, going up to one girl after another.     Strange faces smiled at Leila - sweetly, vaguely. Strange voices answered, "Of course, my dear." But Leila felt the girls didn't really see her. They were looking towards the men. Why didn't the men begin? What were they waiting for? There they stood, smoothing their gloves, patting their glossy hair and smiling among themselves. Then, quite suddenly, as if they had only just made up their minds that that was what they had to do, the men came gliding over the parquet. There was a joyful flutter among the girls. A tall, fair man flew up to Meg, seized her programme, scribbled something; Meg passed him on to Leila. "May I have the pleasure?" He ducked and smiled. There came a dark man wearing an eyeglass, then cousin Laurie with a friend, and Laura with a little freckled fellow whose tie was crooked. Then quite an old man - fat, with a big bald patch on his head - took her programme and murmured, "Let me see, let me see!" And he was a long time comparing his programme, which looked black with names, with hers. It seemed to give him so much trouble that Leila was ashamed. "Oh, please don't bother," she said eagerly. But instead of replying the fat man wrote something, glanced at her again. "Do I remember this bright little face?" he said softly. "Is it known to me of yore?" At that moment the band began playing; the fat man disappeared. He was tossed away on a great wave of music that came flying over the gleaming floor, breaking the groups up into couples, scattering them, sending them spinning ...     Leila had learned to dance at boarding school. Every Saturday afternoon the boarders were hurried off to a little corrugated iron mission hall where Miss Eccles (of London) held her "select" classes. But the difference between that dusty-smelling hall - with calico texts on the walls, the poor terrified little woman in a brown velvet toque with rabbit's ears thumping the cold piano, Miss Eccles poking the girls' feet with her long white wand - and this was so tremendous that Leila was sure if her partner didn't come and she had to listen to that marvelous music and to watch the others sliding, gliding over the golden floor, she would die at least, or faint, or lift her arms and fly out of one of those dark windows that showed the stars.     "Ours, I think--" Some one bowed, smiled, and offered her his arm; she hadn't to die after all. Some one's hand pressed her waist, and she floated away like a flower that is tossed into a pool.     "Quite a good floor, isn't it?" drawled a faint voice close to her ear.     "I think it's most beautifully slippery," said Leila.​</a>

Gospel Mark 9:30-37:
30 Jesus and his disciples left from there and began a journey through Galilee, but he did not wish anyone to know about it.
31 He was teaching his disciples and telling them, “The Son of Man is to be handed over to men and they will kill him, and three days after his death the Son of Man will rise.”
32 But they did not understand the saying, and they were afraid to question him.
33 They came to Capernaum and, once inside the house, he began to ask them, “What were you arguing about on the way?”
34 But they remained silent. They had been discussing among themselves on the way who was the greatest.
35 Then he sat down, called the Twelve, and said to them, “If anyone wishes to be first, he shall be the last of all and the servant of all.”
36 Taking a child, he placed it in their midst, and putting his arms around it, he said to them,
37 “Whoever receives one child such as this in my name, receives me; and whoever receives me, receives not me but the One who sent me.”

It is very important that you should choose the person you
will marry and stay with that person. There are many
people now who believe in serial love, loving one person
after another. I don’t think that is good for our mental
health. I think we should get it over with. Love is like
measles, you know. You only get it once in your lifetime and
you are immune forever. I am very happy to say that is
what happened to me. I am completely immune to any
temptation. All men who have passed my life after I got
married might as well have been sticks of furniture.

Fellow Israelites, listen to this: Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders, and signs, which God did among you through him, as you yourselves know. This man was handed over to you by God’s deliberate plan and foreknowledge; and you, with the help of wicked men, Or of those not having the law (that is, Gentiles) put him to death by nailing him to the cross.
Acts 2: 14, 22-23
Psalms:
Keep me safe, my God,
for in you I take refuge.
I say to the Lord, “You are my Lord;
apart from you, I have no good thing.”</a>

                                            Apo on the wall by bj patino
There’s this man’s photo on the wall
Of my father’s office at home, you
Know, where father brings his work,
Where he doesn’t look strange
Still wearing his green uniform
And colored breast plates, where,
To prove that he works hard, he
Also brought a photo of his boss
Whom he calls Apo, so Apo could
You know, hang around on the wall
Behind him and look over his shoulders
To make sure he’s snappy and all.
Father snapped at me once, caught me
Sneaking around his office at home
Looking at the stuff on his wall- handguns,
Plaques, a sword, medals a rifle-
Told me that was no place for a boy
Only men, when he didn’t really
Have to tell me because, you know,
That photo of Apo on the wall was already
Looking at me around,
His eyes following me like he was
That scary Jesus in the hallway, saying
I know what you’re doing.
Question:
what kind of values does the persona's father want to teach his child, specifically, about what it means to be a man? Do you agree with this values? Why or why not?</a>

Gospel Mark 9:30-37:
30 Jesus and his disciples left from there and began a journey through Galilee, but he did not wish anyone to know about it.
31 He was teaching his disciples and telling them, “The Son of Man is to be handed over to men and they will kill him, and three days after his death the Son of Man will rise.”
32 But they did not understand the saying, and they were afraid to question him.
33 They came to Capernaum and, once inside the house, he began to ask them, “What were you arguing about on the way?”
34 But they remained silent. They had been discussing among themselves on the way who was the greatest.
35 Then he sat down, called the Twelve, and said to them, “If anyone wishes to be first, he shall be the last of all and the servant of all.”
36 Taking a child, he placed it in their midst, and putting his arms around it, he said to them,
37 “Whoever receives one child such as this in my name, receives me; and whoever receives me, receives not me but the One who sent me.”

Determine the acceleration.Can you answer this can you give me the solution the given and the answer I hope you answer this correctly thank youu​</h2><br />
                        <p>1) To find the average velocity during the men's marathon, we need to divide the distance by the time. First, we need to convert the time into seconds:</p><p>2:03.138 hours x 60 minutes/hour x 60 seconds/minute = 7398.8 seconds</p><p></p><p>Average velocity = distance ÷ time</p><p></p><p>Average velocity = 42.195 km ÷ 7398.8 s</p><p></p><p>Average velocity = 0.005707 km/s</p><p></p><p>Since we want the velocity in m/s, we can convert km/s to m/s by multiplying by 1000:</p><p></p><p>Average velocity = 0.005707 km/s x 1000 m/km</p><p></p><p>Average velocity = 5.707 m/s</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the average velocity during the men's marathon was approximately 5.707 m/s.</p><p></p><p>2) To find the average velocity of the student, we need to divide the displacement by the time:</p><p>Average velocity = displacement ÷ time</p><p></p><p>Average velocity = 304 m ÷ 180 s</p><p></p><p>Average velocity = 1.69 m/s north</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the student's average velocity was 1.69 m/s north.</p><p></p><p>3) To find the acceleration of the car, we can use the formula:</p><p>Acceleration = (final velocity - initial velocity) ÷ time</p><p></p><p>Since the car starts from rest, the initial velocity is 0 m/s. We need to convert the distance to meters:</p><p></p><p>Distance = 11 cm = 0.11 m</p><p></p><p>Acceleration = (final velocity - 0 m/s) ÷ 5.21 s</p><p></p><p>We do not have the final velocity, but we can use the formula:</p><p></p><p>Distance = (initial velocity x time) + (0.5 x acceleration x time^2)</p><p></p><p>Since the car starts from rest, the initial velocity is 0 m/s. We can rearrange the formula to solve for acceleration:</p><p></p><p>Acceleration = 2 x (distance - (initial velocity x time)) ÷ time^2</p><p></p><p>Acceleration = 2 x (0.11 m - (0 m/s x 5.21 s)) ÷ (5.21 s)^2</p><p></p><p>Acceleration = 0.042 m/s^2</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the acceleration of the car is approximately 0.042 m/s^2.</p><p></p><p>4) To find the acceleration of the bike, we can use the formula:</p><p>Acceleration = (final velocity - initial velocity) ÷ time</p><p></p><p>Since the bike starts from rest, the initial velocity is 0 m/s.

The Bear and the Two Travelers
TWO MEN were traveling together, when a Bear suddenly met them on their path. One of them climbed up quickly into a tree and concealed himself in the branches. The other, seeing that he must be attacked, fell flat on the ground, and when the Bear came up and felt him with his snout, and smelt him all over, he held his breath, and feigned the appearance of death as much as he could. The Bear soon left him, for it said he will not touch a dead body. When he was quite gone, the other Traveler descended from the tree, and jocularly inquired of his friend what it was the Bear had whispered in his ear. “He gave me this advice,” his companion replied. “Never travel with a friend who deserts you at the approach of danger.”</h2><br />

                            11. All the girls stood grouped together at one side of the doors, the men at the other, and the chaperones in dark dresses, smiling rather foolishly, walked with little careful steps over the polished floor towards the stage.     "This is my little country cousin Leila. Be nice to her. Find her partners; she's under my wing," said Meg, going up to one girl after another.     Strange faces smiled at Leila - sweetly, vaguely. Strange voices answered, "Of course, my dear." But Leila felt the girls didn't really see her. They were looking towards the men. Why didn't the men begin? What were they waiting for? There they stood, smoothing their gloves, patting their glossy hair and smiling among themselves. Then, quite suddenly, as if they had only just made up their minds that that was what they had to do, the men came gliding over the parquet. There was a joyful flutter among the girls. A tall, fair man flew up to Meg, seized her programme, scribbled something; Meg passed him on to Leila. "May I have the pleasure?" He ducked and smiled. There came a dark man wearing an eyeglass, then cousin Laurie with a friend, and Laura with a little freckled fellow whose tie was crooked. Then quite an old man - fat, with a big bald patch on his head - took her programme and murmured, "Let me see, let me see!" And he was a long time comparing his programme, which looked black with names, with hers. It seemed to give him so much trouble that Leila was ashamed. "Oh, please don't bother," she said eagerly. But instead of replying the fat man wrote something, glanced at her again. "Do I remember this bright little face?" he said softly. "Is it known to me of yore?" At that moment the band began playing; the fat man disappeared. He was tossed away on a great wave of music that came flying over the gleaming floor, breaking the groups up into couples, scattering them, sending them spinning ...     Leila had learned to dance at boarding school. Every Saturday afternoon the boarders were hurried off to a little corrugated iron mission hall where Miss Eccles (of London) held her "select" classes. But the difference between that dusty-smelling hall - with calico texts on the walls, the poor terrified little woman in a brown velvet toque with rabbit's ears thumping the cold piano, Miss Eccles poking the girls' feet with her long white wand - and this was so tremendous that Leila was sure if her partner didn't come and she had to listen to that marvelous music and to watch the others sliding, gliding over the golden floor, she would die at least, or faint, or lift her arms and fly out of one of those dark windows that showed the stars.     "Ours, I think--" Some one bowed, smiled, and offered her his arm; she hadn't to die after all. Some one's hand pressed her waist, and she floated away like a flower that is tossed into a pool.     "Quite a good floor, isn't it?" drawled a faint voice close to her ear.     "I think it's most beautifully slippery," said Leila.​</h2><br />

                            13. Make a Reflection on September 19 2021 Gospel 
Gospel Mark 9:30-37:
30 Jesus and his disciples left from there and began a journey through Galilee, but he did not wish anyone to know about it.
31 He was teaching his disciples and telling them, “The Son of Man is to be handed over to men and they will kill him, and three days after his death the Son of Man will rise.”
32 But they did not understand the saying, and they were afraid to question him.
33 They came to Capernaum and, once inside the house, he began to ask them, “What were you arguing about on the way?”
34 But they remained silent. They had been discussing among themselves on the way who was the greatest.
35 Then he sat down, called the Twelve, and said to them, “If anyone wishes to be first, he shall be the last of all and the servant of all.”
36 Taking a child, he placed it in their midst, and putting his arms around it, he said to them,
37 “Whoever receives one child such as this in my name, receives me; and whoever receives me, receives not me but the One who sent me.”

It is very important that you should choose the person you
will marry and stay with that person. There are many
people now who believe in serial love, loving one person
after another. I don’t think that is good for our mental
health. I think we should get it over with. Love is like
measles, you know. You only get it once in your lifetime and
you are immune forever. I am very happy to say that is
what happened to me. I am completely immune to any
temptation. All men who have passed my life after I got
married might as well have been sticks of furniture.

It is a reflection of the scenario of what and how the Filipinos experienced the tragic and traumatic event throughout the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines. “Apo on the wall” shows the real situation concerning with the different perspective between millennial and those who lived through Martial law.

The other, seeing that he must be attacked, feel flat on the ground, and when the Bear came up and felt him with his snout, and smelt him all over, he held his breath, and feigned the appearance of death as much as he could. The Bear soon left him, for it is said he will not touch a dead body.

First Reading:
Peter stood up with the Eleven, raised his voice, and addressed the crowd: “Fellow Jews and all of you who live in Jerusalem, let me explain this to you; listen carefully to what I say. Fellow Israelites, listen to this: Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders, and signs, which God did among you through him, as you yourselves know. This man was handed over to you by God’s deliberate plan and foreknowledge; and you, with the help of wicked men, Or of those not having the law (that is, Gentiles) put him to death by nailing him to the cross.

                            29. Apo on the wall by bj patino
There’s this man’s photo on the wall
Of my father’s office at home, you
Know, where father brings his work,
Where he doesn’t look strange
Still wearing his green uniform
And colored breast plates, where,
To prove that he works hard, he
Also brought a photo of his boss
Whom he calls Apo, so Apo could
You know, hang around on the wall
Behind him and look over his shoulders
To make sure he’s snappy and all.
Father snapped at me once, caught me
Sneaking around his office at home
Looking at the stuff on his wall- handguns,
Plaques, a sword, medals a rifle-
Told me that was no place for a boy
Only men, when he didn’t really
Have to tell me because, you know,
That photo of Apo on the wall was already
Looking at me around,
His eyes following me like he was
That scary Jesus in the hallway, saying
I know what you’re doing.
Question:
what kind of values does the persona's father want to teach his child, specifically, about what it means to be a man? Do you agree with this values? Why or why not?</h2><br />
                        <p>The persona's father wants to teach his child about the values of hard work, responsibility, and obedience to authority. He displays symbols of his own hard work and dedication to his job, such as his uniform, breast plates, and photo of his boss, to emphasize these values. The father also uses the image of his boss, Apo, to reinforce the idea that his work is being monitored and that he must be diligent and "snappy" in his duties.</p><p></p><p>Whether one agrees with these values depends on individual perspectives and beliefs. On one hand, values such as hard work and responsibility are generally regarded as positive traits and can lead to personal and professional success. On the other hand, obedience to authority can be seen as a negative value if it results in blindly following orders or suppressing one's own thoughts and opinions.</p><p></p><p>It's also worth considering the context in which these values are being taught. In the poem, the father uses fear to enforce obedience, with the image of Apo on the wall appearing to "follow" the child and "scare" him into doing what is expected of him. This kind of authoritarian approach to child-rearing may not be seen as healthy or appropriate by everyone.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the values the father wants to teach his child in the poem are a mix of positive and potentially negative traits, and whether one agrees with these values is subjective and depends on individual perspectives.</p><br />

                            30. Make a Reflection on September 19 2021 Gospel
Gospel Mark 9:30-37:
30 Jesus and his disciples left from there and began a journey through Galilee, but he did not wish anyone to know about it.
31 He was teaching his disciples and telling them, “The Son of Man is to be handed over to men and they will kill him, and three days after his death the Son of Man will rise.”
32 But they did not understand the saying, and they were afraid to question him.
33 They came to Capernaum and, once inside the house, he began to ask them, “What were you arguing about on the way?”
34 But they remained silent. They had been discussing among themselves on the way who was the greatest.
35 Then he sat down, called the Twelve, and said to them, “If anyone wishes to be first, he shall be the last of all and the servant of all.”
36 Taking a child, he placed it in their midst, and putting his arms around it, he said to them,
37 “Whoever receives one child such as this in my name, receives me; and whoever receives me, receives not me but the One who sent me.”

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Refection on Mark 9:30-37</strong></p><p>This is a momentous occasion and a remarkable milestone for Jesus and the disciples. As Jesus takes his first steps toward Jerusalem, he foreshadows his suffering. His disciples don't understand what he is saying, even if he is trying to teach them. The disciples are depicted in the narrative as slow and dense, unable to comprehend the ramifications of following Jesus. They are apprehensive about approaching him with queries. They are afraid to ask tough questions. Instead, they are consumed by false ambition, self-interest, and rivalry. The followers who were chosen for a unique purpose quarrel about their rank, honor, and significance.</p><p>It's odd that, when Jesus was teaching the apostles about the great act of love he was about to perform on the cross, they were focused on something very different. In all sincere acts of love, the focus is always on the one who is loved, and the joy received in doing so is the satisfaction.</p><p>Jesus will never deceive anyone. He reveals the truth about his suffering to his disciples. The mystery of the cross is presented in a straightforward manner. He doesn't want them to be misled by the picture of a wonderful King who performs miracles. Jesus acts on a much profound level: he relates with all suffering throughout the past and joins them in sympathy, even if it costs him his life. <strong>This is the love that will free us from the grip of evil. God is with the earth's outcasts and will give them priority in his kingdom.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>A Prayer:</strong></p><p>"Your message is obvious, Lord. God-pleasing desire is demonstrated by humble devotion to others. Glory is found in serving the most inconsequential members of society - the impoverished, the weak, the neglected, and the despised. I'm not different from the disciples, Lord. Your gospel call to loving service can be ignored, rejected, or tamed by me as well. Now that we've each taken a seat, please remind me that true greatness is found in selfless devotion to others. Let me take note of what I can learn about proper attitudes from small children.</p><p>You tried to warn your disciples about the bad news and the good news,  but they refused to listen. They were engrossed in personal rivalries and jealousies, as I am all too frequently. It takes a lifetime to realize how absurd my ego-trips are. Lord, don't be discouraged by my nonsense. Continue to instruct me every day."</p><p></p><p>For more information on how to read the Holy Scriptures, check this </p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/2824859</p><p>For more information about the Bible, check this </p><p>https://brainly.in/question/4183999
