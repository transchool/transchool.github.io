The researchers in quantitative type of research must focus on a specific research question that can be addressed in the study. 3. In quantitative research, it requires a careful review of the research literatures and developing hypotheses that frequently come from social theory. 4. The questionnaires or experiments will be employed in quantitative study. 5. Quantitative Research involves counting or measuring and often statistical tests are applied to detect or confirm tendencies. 6. Probability or non-probability sampling approaches in quantitative study are required from the researchers before drawing a sample size. 7. Using questionnaire is one of the most popular tools for the quantitative research.​</a>
