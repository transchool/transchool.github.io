The Boy Who Cried Wolf
Aesop's fable
A. Directions: Read the passage and complete the activity below.
Once upon a time, in a beautiful village near lush rolling hills, there was a boy
who watched over the village's sheep. Being alone up in the hills was very boring
to scare off the wolf
scream, "Wolf, woln" The villagers grabbed whatever they could and ran up the hill
When they reached the top, they realized they had been tricked by the
mischievous boy. He laughed and laughed until the villagers angrily walked down
the hill. Even the sheep were not amused. The boy continued to call wolf, and the
villagers warned him that the next time they would no longer believe him. The boy
shrugged off the warning and laid down for a nap.
One lazy afternoon, the boy heard a terrible sound. Before he could even prepare
himself a wolf appeared right
before him, and began
chasing the entire village's
sheepl The boy screamed, “Wolf,
wolfl” but having lied so many times, the people of
the village just ignored him. With no one to help him fend off the wolf, the sheep all
ran away, and the boy was left crying on the hill.

To amuse himself he took a great breath a sang out, "Wolf Wolf! The Wolf is chasing the sheep! The villagers came running up the hill to help the boy drive the wolf away. But when the amived at the top of the hill, they found no wolf The boy laughed at the sight of their angry faces - Don't cry 'wolf, shepherd boy," said the villagers, when there's no wolfr They went grumbing back down the hill Later, the boy sang out again, Wolf Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!" To his naughty delight, he watched the villagers run up the M to help him drive the wolf away When the villagers saw no wolf they stemly said, "Save your fnghtened song for when there is really something wrong! Don't cry wolf when there IS NO wolf!" But the boy just grnned and watched them go grumbling down the hill once more Later, he saw a REAL wolf prowling about his flock Alarmed, he leaped to his feet and sang out as loudly as he could, Wolft Wolf But the villagers thought he was trying to fool them again, and so they didn't come At sunset, everyone wondered why the shepherd boy hadn't returned to the village with their sheep. They went up the hill to find the boy. They found him weeping "There really was a wolf here! The flock has scattered! I ched out, Wolfi- Why didn't you come? An old man tried to comfort the boy as they weled back to the village.

The Boy Who Cried Wolf
Aesop's fable
A. Directions: Read the passage and complete the activity below.
Once upon a time, in a beautiful village near lush rolling hills, there was a boy
who watched over the village's sheep. Being alone up in the hills was very boring
to scare off the wolf
scream, "Wolf, woln" The villagers grabbed whatever they could and ran up the hill
When they reached the top, they realized they had been tricked by the
mischievous boy. He laughed and laughed until the villagers angrily walked down
the hill. Even the sheep were not amused. The boy continued to call wolf, and the
villagers warned him that the next time they would no longer believe him. The boy
shrugged off the warning and laid down for a nap.
One lazy afternoon, the boy heard a terrible sound. Before he could even prepare
himself a wolf appeared right
before him, and began
chasing the entire village's
sheepl The boy screamed, “Wolf,
wolfl” but having lied so many times, the people of
the village just ignored him. With no one to help him fend off the wolf, the sheep all
ran away, and the boy was left crying on the hill.
