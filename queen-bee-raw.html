                                            An average bee hive consists of about 20,000 bees within the colony. Within the colony, there are three types of bees and each has its own important job. There is only one queen bee in the hive, and her only job is to fill the hive with eggs. A queen will lay about 1,500 eggs a day. Male bees are called drones. Their only job to mate with the queen. Worker bees, on the other hand, are extremely busy. There are female bees that lay no eggs. They tend the hive by taking care of the babies, building honeycombs, and keeping the hive cool. Some worker bees also leave the hive to go and collect nectar and pollen.3 supporting details​</a>

                            17. Read the paragraphs and make an outline. Honeybees live together in colonies made up of hives that have many chambers and cells. Each colony has three types of honeybee: the queen bee, the worker bees and drones. The queen lays eggs. Worker bees are fem ales that do not lay eggs. They build and repair the hives, gather food and defend the hive. Drones are male bees whose job is to mate with the queen Termites live in colonies. Each colony consists of a large nest made up of chambers and cells. Termite colonies are also of three types. The king and queen make up one type. They mate together to produce eggs. Worker termites build and repair the nest and take care of all other termites. Soldier termites defend the nest.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Her function in the hive is one of production. She is normally the only reproductive female in the colony. Egg-laying begins in early spring, initiated when the first fresh pollen is brought home by the workers. Egg production will continue until fall, or as long as pollen is available.
</p><p>
</p><p>At the height of her productivity, the queen could lay as many as 2000 eggs each day. A queen bee can live for up to five years, but her period of usefulness rarely exceeds two or three years. Younger queens produce many more eggs, and older ones may produce excessive drones. Many beekeepers re-queen their colonies every year or two. Older queens are often superseded (replaced) by the workers without any assistance, or even knowledge, of the beekeeper. Good quality queens can be reared by an experienced beekeeper, but a beginner will usually do better to buy good queens from a reputable producer.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>pwede po ako e brainlist po ako plsssana maka tolong ako<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><strong>The queen's only job is to lay eggs and a drone's job is to mate with the queen.</strong> The <strong>worker bees</strong> are responsible for everything else: gathering <strong>nectar, guarding the hive and honey, caring for the queen and larvae, keeping the hive clean, and producing honey.</strong>A honey bee colony typically consists of three kinds of adult bees: <strong>workers,</strong> <strong>drones, and a queen.</strong><strong>Drones</strong> are <strong>male bees</strong> and their sole purpose is to mate with the <strong>queen</strong>: they <strong>don't work, don't make honey, and can't sting.</strong> Since a queen only needs to mate once, <strong>most of the drones</strong> <strong>won't even get the chance to fulfill their role.</strong> But<strong> worker bees keep them around</strong>, just in case a <strong>new queen needs mating.</strong><strong>A worker bee</strong> is any<strong> female bee </strong>that <strong>lacks the full reproductive capacity</strong> of the<strong> colony's queen bee; </strong>under<strong> most circumstances, </strong>this is<strong> correlated to an increase</strong> in <strong>certain non-reproductive activities relative to a queen</strong><strong>A queen bee</strong> is typically <strong>an adult, mated female that lives in a colony or hive of honey bees.</strong> With <strong>fully developed reproductive organs,</strong> <strong>the queen</strong> is usually <strong>the mother of most,</strong> if not all, of the bees in the beehive.<br />

                            23. II.	Topic outline (10 points) Direction: Read the paragraph below and make a topic outline. 	Honeybees live together in colonies made up of hives that have many chambers and cells. Each colony has three types of honeybee: the queen bee, the worker bees and drones. The queen bee lays eggs. Worker bees are females that do not lay eggs. They build and repair the hives, gather food and defend the hive. Drones are male bees whose job is to mate with the queen. 	Termites live in common. Each colony consists of a large nest made up of chambers and cells. Termite colonies are also of three types. The king termite leads the colony. The queen mate with the king termite to produce eggs. Worker termites build and repair the nest and take care of all other termites. Soldier termites defend the nest. ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I. </p><p>A. Her function in the hive is one of production. She is normally the only reproductive female in the colony.</p><p>B. Egg-laying begins in early spring, initiated when the first fresh pollen is brought home by the workers.</p><p>C. Egg production will continue until fall, or as long as pollen is available.</p><p>D. At the height of her productivity, the queen could lay as many as 2000 eggs each day. A queen bee can live for up to five years, but her period of usefulness rarely exceeds two or three years.</p><p></p><p>II. </p><p>A. Younger queens produce many more eggs, and older ones may produce excessive drones.</p><p>B. Many beekeepers re-queen their colonies every year or two. Older queens are often superseded (replaced) by the workers without any assistance, or even knowledge, of the beekeeper.</p><p>C. Good quality queens can be reared by an experienced beekeeper.</p><p>D. Beginner will usually do better to buy good queens from a reputable producer.</p><br />
