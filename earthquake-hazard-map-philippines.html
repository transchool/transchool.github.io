Places where active and potentially active volcanoes are prone to hazards of volcanic actvities or volcanic eruptions. 38 Land pollution is the degradation of earth's land surfaces often caused by human activities and its misuse .39 Kaingin system is a method that cuts down and burns off the existing vegetation. 40 Clear-cutting is a method done by logging companies to cut down every marketable tree from a selected area to harvest timber.​</a>

This time let's see how our country, Philippines, is at risk of disasters related to geologic activities. As we are known to be resilient (flexible), we have high hopes that our resilience could also mean preparedness at all times. What you need: V separate sheet of paper and ball pen Philippine geographic/political map (see page 15) What you have to do: 1. Go to page 15. Look at the Philippine map. Can you pinpoint where you are now? 2. Study the hazard maps found on pages 16-19 that will show you areas in our country that are prone to natural disasters like earthquakes (Figure 3), landslides Figure 4), volcanic eruptions (Figure 5), and tsunamis (Figure 6). 3. Look at the geographical or political map of the Philippines on page 15. Try to compare the areas in Figures 3 to 6 (pages 16-19) provinces with darker colors. These are the high-risk areas to the specified natural disasters.​</a>

                                            Hazard maps indicate settlement areas that are at risk from floods, avalanches, landslides and rockfall. A separate map exists for each of these hazard categories. The maps can be used to identify areas that could be flooded by the next storm, locations where avalanches could be released and slopes where a landslide could arise. The hazard maps also provide detailed information about the causes, course, spatial scope, intensity and probability of occurrence of natural hazard events. Hazard maps are created and used in conjunction with several natural disasters. Different hazard maps have different uses. For instance, the hazard map created by the Rizal Geological Survey is used by Rizalian insurance agencies in order to properly adjust insurance for people living in hazardous areas. Hazard maps created for flooding are also used in insurance rate adjustments. Hazard maps can also be useful in determining the risks of living in a certain area. Hazard maps can help people become aware of the dangers they might face from natural disasters in a specific area. Using the hazard maps shown above, identify the areas that are prone to earthquake, landslide, tsunami or volcanic eruption. 1. In Figure 30-1, identify the areas in Bacoor City that are moderately- susceptible for earthquake-induced landslide. 2. Which ones are not susceptible to the hazard? 3. In Figure 30-2, identify the regions in the Philippines that are prone to P 12  earthquake of the highest degree of intensity. 4. Which places are prone to tsunami? 5.

                            15. Hazard maps indicate settlement areas that are at risk from floods, avalanches, landslides and rockfall. A separate map exists for each of these hazard categories. The maps can be used to identify areas that could be flooded by the next storm, locations where avalanches could be released and slopes where a landslide could arise. The hazard maps also provide detailed information about the causes, course, spatial scope, intensity and probability of occurrence of natural hazard events. Hazard maps are created and used in conjunction with several natural disasters. Different hazard maps have different uses. For instance, the hazard map created by the Rizal Geological Survey is used by Rizalian insurance agencies in order to properly adjust insurance for people living in hazardous areas. Hazard maps created for flooding are also used in insurance rate adjustments. Hazard maps can also be useful in determining the risks of living in a certain area. Hazard maps can help people become aware of the dangers they might face from natural disasters in a specific area. Using the hazard maps shown above, identify the areas that are prone to earthquake, landslide, tsunami or volcanic eruption. 1. In Figure 30-1, identify the areas in Bacoor City that are moderately- susceptible for earthquake-induced landslide. 2. Which ones are not susceptible to the hazard? 3. In Figure 30-2, identify the regions in the Philippines that are prone to P 12  earthquake of the highest degree of intensity. 4. Which places are prone to tsunami? 5. In figure 30-3, identify the areas that have low risk of volcanic eruption</h2><br />
