Still I Rise Poem by Maya Angelou You may write me down in history With your bitter, twisted lies, You may trod me in the very dirt But still, like dust, I'll rise. Does my sassiness upset you? Why are you beset with gloom? 'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells Pumping in my living room. Just like moons and like suns, With the certainty of tides, Just like hopes springing high, Still I'll rise. Did you want to see me broken? Bowed head and lowered eyes? Shoulders falling down like teardrops, Weakened by my soulful cries? Does my haughtiness offend you? Don't you take it awful hard 'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines Diggin' in my own backyard. You may shoot me with your words, You may cut me with your eyes, You may kill me with your hatefulness, But still, like air, I'll rise. Does my sexiness upset you? Does it come as a surprise That I dance like I've got diamonds At the meeting of my thighs? Out of the huts of history's shame I rise Up from a past that's rooted in pain I rise I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide, Welling and swelling I bear in the tide. Leaving behind nights of terror and fear I rise Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear I rise Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave. Raise your Flag Sung by KZ Tandingan What do you wanna be? Will you believe me if I tell you You can be anything you want? Where do you wanna go? Will you believe me if I tell you That you'll see the silver lining with your dreams? 'Cause when they say we can't, we have to be braver Together we'll reach for the impossible Even when you think that it's crazy The longest journey begins with a single step from you and me Raise your flag For the ones who think they can't get somewhere Raise your flag For the ones who think no one believes in them Raise your flag For the ones who already feel like giving up I stand here, not as one For we're all in this together Reach high and raise your flag Raise your flag Raise your flag, oh oh Raise your flag Don't ever let them put you down You're a fighter Never saying never And learn to lift each other up We'll be stronger If we get together, we'll be soaring even higherpls pasagot ng tamareport nonesense.​</a>

Still I Rise Poem by Maya Angelou You may write me down in history With your bitter, twisted lies, You may trod me in the very dirt But still, like dust, I'll rise. Does my sassiness upset you? Why are you beset with gloom? 'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells Pumping in my living room. Just like moons and like suns, With the certainty of tides, Just like hopes springing high, Still I'll rise. Did you want to see me broken? Bowed head and lowered eyes? Shoulders falling down like teardrops, Weakened by my soulful cries? Does my haughtiness offend you? Don't you take it awful hard 'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines Diggin' in my own backyard. You may shoot me with your words, You may cut me with your eyes, You may kill me with your hatefulness, But still, like air, I'll rise. Does my sexiness upset you? Does it come as a surprise That I dance like I've got diamonds At the meeting of my thighs? Out of the huts of history's shame I rise Up from a past that's rooted in pain I rise I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide, Welling and swelling I bear in the tide. Leaving behind nights of terror and fear I rise Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear I rise Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave. Raise your Flag Sung by KZ Tandingan What do you wanna be? Will you believe me if I tell you You can be anything you want? Where do you wanna go? Will you believe me if I tell you That you'll see the silver lining with your dreams? 'Cause when they say we can't, we have to be braver Together we'll reach for the impossible Even when you think that it's crazy The longest journey begins with a single step from you and me Raise your flag For the ones who think they can't get somewhere Raise your flag For the ones who think no one believes in them Raise your flag For the ones who already feel like giving up I stand here, not as one For we're all in this together Reach high and raise your flag Raise your flag Raise your flag, oh oh Raise your flag Don't ever let them put you down You're a fighter Never saying never And learn to lift each other up We'll be stronger If we get together, we'll be soaring even higherpls pasagot ng tamareport nonesense.​</h2><br />
