Countries where the majority of respondents responded that they would accept COVID-19 vaccination included Malaysia (96.0%), Bangladesh (93.6%), and Iraq (91.8%). The majority of the participants from Vietnam (86.0%) and Turkey (74.7%) expressed hesitance to receive COVID-19<strong> vaccine.</strong> <strong>Perceived vaccine effectiveness ranged from 67.8% in Egypt to 95.9% in Malaysia. The participants believed that convenience, health providers’ advice, and costs of vaccines are important for people to decide whether to accept COVID-19 vaccines.</strong> Country of residence, age, sex, level of education, area of residence, marital status, and family economic status were significantly associated with tendency to undergo COVID-19 vaccination and the perception that COVID-19 vaccine decision-making is influenced by convenience. The findings of this study provide useful guidance for tailored interventions to enhance the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine.
