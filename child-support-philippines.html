                                            In the Philippines, the first week of October is Elderly Filipino Week. Eventsare held all over the country to deepen people's understanding of the role olderpeople play in society. In 2016, a kilometer walk called the Walk for Life washeld on October 3 at 16 different locations around the country.Respect for one's elders is traditional in the Philippines. When a Filipinochild meets an older family member, the youth customarily greets them with agesture called mano po, taking the older relative's hand and placing it on his orher own forehead to express profound respect for the elder.The idea that caring for older people is the responsibility of their children isrooted as firmly in Filipino society as it is elsewhere in Southeast Asia. For thatreason, older people usually live with their families. However, Metropolitan Ma-nila and neighboring regions are home to many older residents who came to thecity for work but now remain there alone, lacking the funds to return to theirhometowns or coming from families that are too poor to provide them with ade-quate care.Local communities, private organizations, andnongovernmentalorganizations are banding together to develop a range of ways of supportingolder people in such situations,Guide Questions:1.

                                            what are some ways on how we can be able to lessen the rate of population growth in the philippines?
1. Empower women
Studies show that women with access to reproductive health services find it easier to break out of poverty, while those who work are more likely to use birth control. The United Nations Population Fund aims to tackle both issues at once, running microcredit projects to turn young women into advocates for reproductive health.
2. Promote family planning
Simply educating men and women about contraception can have a big impact. When Iran introduced a national family planning programme in 1989, its fertility rate fell from 5.6 births per woman to 2.6 in a decade. A similar effort in Rwanda saw a threefold increase in contraception usage in just five years.
3. Make education entertaining
The US-based Population Media Center gets creative to reach women. Its radio soap operas, which feature culturally specific stories about reproductive issues, have been heard by as many as 500 million people in 50 countries. In Ethiopia, 63 per cent of women seeking reproductive health services reported tuning in.
4. Government incentives
Those at UK charity Population Matters believe there should be a senior government official responsible for addressing population-related issues. They urge governments to promote “responsible parenthood” and say subsidies should be limited to the first two children unless the family is living in poverty.
5) One-child legislation
During China’s high controversial one-child policy, fertility fell from six births per woman in the 1960s to 1.5 in 2014. However, Amnesty International reports that the policy led to coerced or forced abortions and sterilisations. It also disrupted traditional support structures for the elderly and led to a gender imbalance.</a>

Nutrition and the Philippines: 'Nation at risk' Fritzie Rodriguez MANILA, Philippines-"Undernutrition is the single greatest threat to a child's life." Dr Martin Parreño, National Program Officer of the World Food Programme-Philippines, called on Filipinos to pay more attention to child malnutrition at all times-with or without disasters.Latest statistics from the National Nutrition Council (NNC) showed that 67% of Filipino families are not eating enough even when there are no calamities. In the Philippines, malnutrition is seen across all age groups-from infancy to adulthood, the 2013 National Nutrition Survey revealed. "At the center of malnutrition's underlying causes is inadequate childcare and feeding practices," Parreño added. "And we don't have a structure curriculum addressing this," he said during the 2014 Dr Juan Salcedo Memorial Lecture organized by the Nutrition Foundation of the Philippines (NFP) on Thursday, October 9. Children who grew up in homes where parents did not care or invest in proper food and hygiene most likely grow up to become the same kind of parents, hence perpetuating the cycle. The Department of Education has been working on integrating health and nutrition lessons in school will curricula. More recent strategies also try to involve parents in classes and school-based supplementary feeding programs. Such efforts, however, will remain fruitless unless more parents realize the value of nutrition and their roles as primary caregivers.

EXERCISES Discuss the reading selection below with your partner and write a 1 paragraph (5 sentences) summary about the important information being discussed in the text Juvenile delinquency is characterized by unruly conduct of youth age 10 to 17, that is beyond parental control and thus requires legal action (Merriam-Webster Dictionary). Drugs, sexual assault, robbery, physical injury and other illegal activities and behaviour that most of the teens commit. In the Philippines, the number of minors involved in delinquency had increased from 10, 388 in 2017 to 11,228 in 2018. Many of our dear teens are engaged in such dreadful and terrifying crimes and activities that you can't imagine they can do because of their young age. The increase of numbers of the juvenile delinquent is quite alarming and worrisome. 15 year old felons and below are spared in trial and jail however the age of the children who partake in such unlawful activities are getting younger and younger, some of this offender's even age as five years old. Due to this, Juvenile Justice and Welfare Act of 2006 increased the minimum age of criminal responsibility that allows the child to undertake criminal proceeding in court. It also requires a minor delinquent to undergo therapy. From study and research, most of the minors who are part of these illicit deeds are ignored and abandoned by their own parents and family or they seek attention from them. Parents must always check on their child and guide them towards the right path away from the dangerous way that can destroy their life and re. In relation to this, Senate President Vicente Sotto II urges the government to support, and to fund the places for rehabilitations for the juvenile delinquents since many of the shelters are neglected and abandoned. The House of Representatives approved on final reading the House Bill 8855 which lowers the criminal charge from 15 to just 12 years old on January 28, 2019. SUMMARY​</a>

Philippine civil law sets out that a person can only be legally married at age 18. But this law does not
apply to Muslims; under another law, a Muslim boy can marry at age 15 while a girl can be married
off when she reaches puberty. The proposed "Girls Not Brides Act," passed by both houses of the
Philippine Congress and now awaiting President Duterte's signature, will make it unlawful for anyon
to marry a child (younger than 18) and make it a criminal offense to officiate such a union. Accordin
to the UN, one in six Fillipino girls are married before age 18.

For thatreason, older people usually live with their families. However, Metropolitan Ma-nila and neighboring regions are home to many older residents who came to thecity for work but now remain there alone, lacking the funds to return to theirhometowns or coming from families that are too poor to provide them with ade-quate care.Local communities, private organizations, andnongovernmentalorganizations are banding together to develop a range of ways of supportingolder people in such situations,Guide Questions:1.

                            14. what are some ways on how we can be able to lessen the rate of population growth in the philippines?
1. Empower women
Studies show that women with access to reproductive health services find it easier to break out of poverty, while those who work are more likely to use birth control. The United Nations Population Fund aims to tackle both issues at once, running microcredit projects to turn young women into advocates for reproductive health.
2. Promote family planning
Simply educating men and women about contraception can have a big impact. When Iran introduced a national family planning programme in 1989, its fertility rate fell from 5.6 births per woman to 2.6 in a decade. A similar effort in Rwanda saw a threefold increase in contraception usage in just five years.
3. Make education entertaining
The US-based Population Media Center gets creative to reach women. Its radio soap operas, which feature culturally specific stories about reproductive issues, have been heard by as many as 500 million people in 50 countries. In Ethiopia, 63 per cent of women seeking reproductive health services reported tuning in.
4. Government incentives
Those at UK charity Population Matters believe there should be a senior government official responsible for addressing population-related issues. They urge governments to promote “responsible parenthood” and say subsidies should be limited to the first two children unless the family is living in poverty.
5) One-child legislation
During China’s high controversial one-child policy, fertility fell from six births per woman in the 1960s to 1.5 in 2014. However, Amnesty International reports that the policy led to coerced or forced abortions and sterilisations. It also disrupted traditional support structures for the elderly and led to a gender imbalance.</h2><br />

Nutrition and the Philippines: 'Nation at risk' Fritzie Rodriguez MANILA, Philippines-"Undernutrition is the single greatest threat to a child's life." Dr Martin Parreño, National Program Officer of the World Food Programme-Philippines, called on Filipinos to pay more attention to child malnutrition at all times-with or without disasters.Latest statistics from the National Nutrition Council (NNC) showed that 67% of Filipino families are not eating enough even when there are no calamities. In the Philippines, malnutrition is seen across all age groups-from infancy to adulthood, the 2013 National Nutrition Survey revealed. "At the center of malnutrition's underlying causes is inadequate childcare and feeding practices," Parreño added. "And we don't have a structure curriculum addressing this," he said during the 2014 Dr Juan Salcedo Memorial Lecture organized by the Nutrition Foundation of the Philippines (NFP) on Thursday, October 9. Children who grew up in homes where parents did not care or invest in proper food and hygiene most likely grow up to become the same kind of parents, hence perpetuating the cycle. The Department of Education has been working on integrating health and nutrition lessons in school will curricula. More recent strategies also try to involve parents in classes and school-based supplementary feeding programs. Such efforts, however, will remain fruitless unless more parents realize the value of nutrition and their roles as primary caregivers.

EXERCISES Discuss the reading selection below with your partner and write a 1 paragraph (5 sentences) summary about the important information being discussed in the text Juvenile delinquency is characterized by unruly conduct of youth age 10 to 17, that is beyond parental control and thus requires legal action (Merriam-Webster Dictionary). Drugs, sexual assault, robbery, physical injury and other illegal activities and behaviour that most of the teens commit. In the Philippines, the number of minors involved in delinquency had increased from 10, 388 in 2017 to 11,228 in 2018. Many of our dear teens are engaged in such dreadful and terrifying crimes and activities that you can't imagine they can do because of their young age. The increase of numbers of the juvenile delinquent is quite alarming and worrisome. 15 year old felons and below are spared in trial and jail however the age of the children who partake in such unlawful activities are getting younger and younger, some of this offender's even age as five years old. Due to this, Juvenile Justice and Welfare Act of 2006 increased the minimum age of criminal responsibility that allows the child to undertake criminal proceeding in court. It also requires a minor delinquent to undergo therapy. From study and research, most of the minors who are part of these illicit deeds are ignored and abandoned by their own parents and family or they seek attention from them. Parents must always check on their child and guide them towards the right path away from the dangerous way that can destroy their life and re. In relation to this, Senate President Vicente Sotto II urges the government to support, and to fund the places for rehabilitations for the juvenile delinquents since many of the shelters are neglected and abandoned. The House of Representatives approved on final reading the House Bill 8855 which lowers the criminal charge from 15 to just 12 years old on January 28, 2019. SUMMARY​</h2><br />

Philippine civil law sets out that a person can only be legally married at age 18. But this law does not
apply to Muslims; under another law, a Muslim boy can marry at age 15 while a girl can be married
off when she reaches puberty. The proposed "Girls Not Brides Act," passed by both houses of the
Philippine Congress and now awaiting President Duterte's signature, will make it unlawful for anyon
to marry a child (younger than 18) and make it a criminal offense to officiate such a union. Accordin
to the UN, one in six Fillipino girls are married before age 18.

_______9. Roses are the best flowers to express your love for someone. My grandfather had a massive rose garden, over 200 different species. Every Friday, he'd go out into the garden, clip a dozen, and make my grandmother a bouquet
_______10. Democracy does not work in a family. Parents should have the ultimate say because they are wiser and their children do not know what is best for themselves.

                        TEST<p>Directions: Identify the type of evidence used in each statement.

Conducting face-to-face classes at this time when there is no vaccine for school age children is too risky. This is supported by Pres. Rodrigo Duterte when he said.

The restaurant next to our school is a good place to go to have a good meal. My friends and I went there once, and we experienced the best service. The staff were all very polite and accommodating. The food is good with a reasonable price.</p><p></p><p><strong>ANECDOTAL </strong>5. I know someone who smoked for decades, and it never produced any significant illness. Those claims about smoking are exaggerated!</p><p></p><p><strong>ANALOGICAL </strong>6. We should not blame the media for deteriorating moral standards.

In the Philippines. there are 2.1 million child laborer's aged 5 to 17 years old based on the 2011 Survey on Children of the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA). About 95 per cent of them are in hazardous work. Sixty-nine per cent of these an aged 15 to 17 years old, beyond the minimum allowable age for work but still exposed to hazardous work</p><p></p><p><strong>TESTIMONIAL </strong>8.
