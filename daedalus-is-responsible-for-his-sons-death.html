                            1. Daedalus was responsible for his son's death?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Daedalus was responsible for his son's death?
<p>
</p><p><strong>
I think Daedalus was partly responsible for his son’s death</strong> because it was his actions that led them to be imprisoned on the tower.<strong> But it was Icarus’s decision to ignore his father's advice that killed him.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>A big part of Icarus’s death was caused by Daedalus decision to:
</strong></p><p>
</p> Help the queen mate with the bullhe was instrumental in the creation of the Minotaur.
<p>
</p><p><strong>Making such a move showed 2 flaws in Daedalus’s personality:
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p>There is a lack of moral judgment lack of loyalty
<p>
</p><p>By helping the queen with such an appalling act, <strong>Daedalus</strong> showed a very low level of morality. I’m sure he knew that such a union would produce the <strong>Minotaur</strong> which<strong> King Minos</strong> saw as an abomination.  </p><p>This all happened despite being accepted and given a position in <strong>Crete</strong> by <strong>King Minos</strong> even though he had a criminal past. In my opinion, <strong>Daedalus</strong> displayed an absolute lack of loyalty to anyone but himself.
</p><p>
</p><p>With regards to his own death, once they jumped off the tower, all the blame falls on<strong> Icarus.</strong> He was given all the advice a parent could give and yet he decided to ignore them. <strong>Icarus </strong>followed the natural youthful instinct of disregarding rules and consequences at a very critical moment and he paid with his life because of it.

                        No. Although he's responsible for his son's safety but he didn't want his son to be dead too.If I am the one who is being asked, I will probably say no. It was Icarus' fault of flying too high. Daedalus just warned his son not to fly so high because the wax-made wings made by him might melt. But because of Icarus' foolishness he didn't listen to his father and flied a little to much making the wax-made wings to melt and that is why Icarus fell unto the sea. <br /><br /><br />

                            4. daedalus is responsible for his son death? give evidence</h2><br />
                        He created a pair of mechanical wings for him and his son so they could use it to "fly" towards  the sun. Or escape. I can't remember it all too well. His son's wings apparently failed and causing him to fall to his death. His son died because of his own invention.we also have answered such question in cauayan highschool the answer is he is no responsible for the death of his son because in the first place he warned his son for not taking the air high and the see not too low<br />

                        Daedalus is responsible for his son's death because he knew that wings he made were not yet proved to be safe and working. And his son, as a teenager Daedalus as a father should know that people in such age do not always follow their parents because they just do what they think is fun. And he could have just lived peacefully in the Labyrinth with his sonFor me, Daedalus is not responsible for Icarus' death because he warned Icarus to not be near the sun or the qax on his wings will melt. It's Icarus' fault that he didn't mind his father's warning.<br />

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1.	<strong>Daedalus is responsible for his son’s death. DISAGREE
</strong></p><p>
</p><p>
</p>	Evidence: <strong>Daedalus</strong> has already <strong>taught</strong> Icarus how to <strong>fly</strong> and <strong>advised</strong> him to stay away from the sun, as the heat would make the wax melt, <strong>kill the wings</strong> and not too close to the sea because it would dampen them and make it difficult to fly.But Icarus was heavy headed and cocky forgetting what his father had said. Daedalus tried to make Icarus realize in vain that his conduct was risky. He fell to sea and <strong>drowned</strong> after <strong>not listening to his father's alarm</strong>. Daedalus still  does not wish to lay his son's life to death.
<p>  </p>Evidence: Neither <strong>Daedalus is responsible for the death of Icarus</strong>. He <strong>warned</strong> his son when he was  <strong>traveling</strong> not to get close to the sun. Yet Icarus denied listening. His death was its end.
For him and his son he created a pair of mechanical wings so they could use it to "fly"  towards the sun. Or just <strong>escape</strong>. I can not recall it all too well. Apparently, his son's wings  <strong>failed</strong> and <strong>caused him to fall to death</strong>. His son <strong>died</strong> of an <strong>invention</strong> of his own.
<p>
</p><p>Related Question:
</p><p>1.	<strong>Daedalus is talented. AGREE
</strong></p><p>
</p>	Evidence: The name stands for "<strong>professional worker.</strong>" He was a <strong>famous artist, inventor, and master craftsman</strong> known for making a lot of <strong>artifacts</strong> that <strong>feature prominently in various myths</strong>. His popular creations were<strong> axis, boat sails, a massive labyrinth called Labyrinth, and human fake wings</strong>.
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2.	<strong>Icarus is foolish. AGREE
</strong></p><p>
</p><p>	Evidence: <strong>Icarus</strong> was too young and too <strong>excited about flight</strong>, although he was <strong>warned</strong>.  He was <strong>fascinated</strong> by the <strong>excitement</strong> of flight and swept away by the <strong>incredible</strong> feeling of  <strong>freedom</strong> and started to fly high to meet the sun, dive low into the sea, and then up again  high. And soon Icarus saw the <strong>melting of his wings</strong> which led him to fall into the sea and  drown.

                        <p>No. For me, Daedalus' plan is a good one because if you are in that kind of situation, its hard for you to think a plan how to escape in that tower and guarded outside. Daedalus' plan was really a skillful one and a bright plan. The only problem was that Icarus disobeyed the rules of his father that's why his plan became useless and caused the death to his son, Icarus.</p><br /><br /><p>Before taking off from the island, Daedalus warned his son to follow closely behind him. But Icarus grew exhilarated by the thrill of flying and began getting careless. Forgetting his father's stern advice, Icarus flew to close to the sun which softened and melted the wax holding together his wings.</p><br />

                        Daedalus cautioned his son because if Icarus were to fly near the sun, his artificial wings would melt in which he would fall off and drown in sea. Daedalus warned his son because he didn't want his son to be in danger. He warned him not to fly too high or too low or else, he'll end up dead. Icarus, being disobedient, disobeyed his father's orders causing such misfortune happened to him.<br />
