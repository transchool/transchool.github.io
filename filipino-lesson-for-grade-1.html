Most importantly, it tastes so good that people consume it daily. However, not much awareness is spread about the harmful effects of junk food. The problem is more serious than you think. Various studies show that junk food impacts our health negatively. They contain higher levels of calories, fats, and sugar. On the contrary, they have very low amounts of healthy nutrients and lack dietary fibers. Parents must discourage their children from consuming junk food because of the ill effects it has on one’s health.

2. A private school is autonomous and generates its own funding through various sources like student tuition, private grants, and endowments. A public school is government-funded and all students attend free of cost. Because of funding from several sources, private schools may teach above and beyond the standard curriculum, may cater to a specific kind of students (gifted, special needs, specific religion/language), or have an alternative curriculum like art, drama, technology, etc. Public schools have to adhere to the curriculum charted out by the district, and cannot deny admission to any child within the residential school zone. There are several preconceived notions regarding private and public schools. Private schools are often assumed to be very expensive, elitist and a better bet for admission to good colleges. Public schools are often thought of as shoddy, less disciplined, and low-grade curriculum. This comparison offers a fair insight into both schools for parents to make an informed decision.

3. Mango float is a Filipino icebox cake dessert made with layers of graham crackers, whipped cream, condensed milk, and ripe mangoes. It is a modern variant of the traditional Filipino crema de fruta cake. Here are the steps to follow to prepare it. Prepare a rectangular glass dish with or without a lid. In a bowl, whisk Nestle cream until smooth. Add the condensed and evaporated milk. Whisk until well combined. Using a ladle, place a small amount of the milk mixture into the bottom of the dish, then place a layer of Graham crackers and top with the sliced mangoes. Ladle a mixture again, slowly pours over the crackers and the mangoes, making sure it covers all of the Graham crackers. Repeat by placing layers of crackers, mangoes, and milk mixture. Top off with Graham crumbs (or just crushed some Graham crackers). Cover and freeze overnight. Serve and enjoy!

5. The schools today and in the past are similar in a few ways and different in some aspects. Both have a learning room, a teacher, and books. However, the classrooms in the past are considered concrete structures where learning should take place. On the other hand, classrooms today utilize technology like LCD projectors, laptops, and other gadgets. Another is that lesson plans in the past were from print materials while lessons of today are from-books and other online platforms. No matter how alike and different the schools in the past and today are, what matters most is how effective learning takes place. *

                                            You are now finished with your lessons in text development. It is time for thefinal check up. This will be graded so take it seriously,Below is a text. Read it carefully and pay attention to details. After reading you willfind questions for you to answer briefly but concise.Each question is scored 5 points: two points for accuracy of answer and three forpresentation of evidence or reason write your answers in your activity notebook.The parol of Pampanga is a mix of Filipino and Spanish culture. TheSpanish introduced us to lanterns and their construction. The Filipinos thenmade use of indigenous materials and creativity to give it a "folk” touch. Asidefrom the form and aesthetic, it is the ritual behind the parol that Filipinoscan draw from. There is a team effort in its correction. The community comestogether to be able to fix the lights. If not, the lights will be all tangled. Agroup of people helping each other in order to reach the goal is a verybeautiful thingIt proves that there is a sense of community in the area. I think in manyplaces around the Philippines especially in Manila- there has been a loss ofthe sense of community. With the rise of capitalism and profit orientedmindset, it has become every man for himself. The sense of community needsto be restored in Filipino culture. Helping one another and the realization thatwe as Filipinos are all connected is important for national progress and theimprovement of the quality of life. I do not mean the kind of quality of life thatcomes out every year that ranks the best quality of life among countries. Imean the kind of quality of life where we can trust our neighbors. Like inBataan, there is a store with no "tindera" just a cash box to drop the cash in.Take what you want and drop the amount into the box. The ease that comesto mind when the door is unlocked but it is fine because the neighborhood issafe. The feeling of being able to depend on the people around you and yourcommunity when you need help- all these come from a sense of community.This is not something new to our culture.Source: The importance of Recognizing our Culture by Pammy Macasaet                                          Questions:1.

                            19. 1. Junk Food is very harmful that is slowly eating away the health of the present generation. The term itself denotes how dangerous it is for our bodies. Most importantly, it tastes so good that people consume it daily. However, not much awareness is spread about the harmful effects of junk food. The problem is more serious than you think. Various studies show that junk food impacts our health negatively. They contain higher levels of calories, fats, and sugar. On the contrary, they have very low amounts of healthy nutrients and lack dietary fibers. Parents must discourage their children from consuming junk food because of the ill effects it has on one’s health.

2. A private school is autonomous and generates its own funding through various sources like student tuition, private grants, and endowments. A public school is government-funded and all students attend free of cost. Because of funding from several sources, private schools may teach above and beyond the standard curriculum, may cater to a specific kind of students (gifted, special needs, specific religion/language), or have an alternative curriculum like art, drama, technology, etc. Public schools have to adhere to the curriculum charted out by the district, and cannot deny admission to any child within the residential school zone. There are several preconceived notions regarding private and public schools. Private schools are often assumed to be very expensive, elitist and a better bet for admission to good colleges. Public schools are often thought of as shoddy, less disciplined, and low-grade curriculum. This comparison offers a fair insight into both schools for parents to make an informed decision.

In a bowl, whisk Nestle cream until smooth. Add the condensed and evaporated milk. Whisk until well combined. Using a ladle, place a small amount of the milk mixture into the bottom of the dish, then place a layer of Graham crackers and top with the sliced mangoes. Ladle a mixture again, slowly pours over the crackers and the mangoes, making sure it covers all of the Graham crackers. Repeat by placing layers of crackers, mangoes, and milk mixture.

He entered a Jesuit-run Ateneo Municipal de Manila in 1872 and obtained a bachelor’s degree with the highest honors in 1876. He studied medicine at the University of Santo Tomas but had to stop because he felt that the Filipino students were being discriminated against by their Dominican tutors. He went to Madrid at Universidad Central de Madrid and in 1885 at the age of 24; he finished his course in Philosophy and Letters with a grade of “Excellent.”

5. The schools today and in the past are similar in a few ways and different in some aspects. Both have a learning room, a teacher, and books. However, the classrooms in the past are considered concrete structures where learning should take place. On the other hand, classrooms today utilize technology like LCD projectors, laptops, and other gadgets. Another is that lesson plans in the past were from print materials while lessons of today are from-books and other online platforms. No matter how alike and different the schools in the past and today are, what matters most is how effective learning takes place. *

After reading you willfind questions for you to answer briefly but concise.Each question is scored 5 points: two points for accuracy of answer and three forpresentation of evidence or reason write your answers in your activity notebook.The parol of Pampanga is a mix of Filipino and Spanish culture. TheSpanish introduced us to lanterns and their construction. The Filipinos thenmade use of indigenous materials and creativity to give it a "folk” touch. Asidefrom the form and aesthetic, it is the ritual behind the parol that Filipinoscan draw from. There is a team effort in its correction. The community comestogether to be able to fix the lights. If not, the lights will be all tangled. Agroup of people helping each other in order to reach the goal is a verybeautiful thingIt proves that there is a sense of community in the area. I think in manyplaces around the Philippines especially in Manila- there has been a loss ofthe sense of community. With the rise of capitalism and profit orientedmindset, it has become every man for himself. The sense of community needsto be restored in Filipino culture. Helping one another and the realization thatwe as Filipinos are all connected is important for national progress and theimprovement of the quality of life. I do not mean the kind of quality of life thatcomes out every year that ranks the best quality of life among countries. Imean the kind of quality of life where we can trust our neighbors. Like inBataan, there is a store with no "tindera" just a cash box to drop the cash in.Take what you want and drop the amount into the box. The ease that comesto mind when the door is unlocked but it is fine because the neighborhood issafe. The feeling of being able to depend on the people around you and yourcommunity when you need help- all these come from a sense of community.This is not something new to our culture.Source: The importance of Recognizing our Culture by Pammy Macasaet                                          Questions:1.

English language. Why? 2Here are several reasons. 3First our teacher in English
inspires us to do our best because she prepares and teaches our lessons in the
English language as well. 4Second, all the other teachers speak to us in English
in all zones of the campus, except during our classes in Filipino and Social
Studies. 5Another is that we are exposed to many activities in which we can
practice speaking well, not to mention being serious in our speech class held in
the laboratory. 6We also have contests in declamation, oral reading and
interpretative reading.
