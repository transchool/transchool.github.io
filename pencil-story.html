After reading, evaluatethe short story using the criteria below. Then, Write a brief review in the comment section.Proud Little PencilBy Joemar L. Furigay"Pencils? They're very unfortunatel" mocked those bom with the privilege of ink."They're dull, too!" mimicked those born with the privilege of color."Truly unlucky!" they chorused in derisionLittle Pencil felt depressed upon hearing what the Pens and Crayons told about themPencils. True, he came from the Pencil family, and he was bound to carry out a Pencil's job. Andhe wasn't proud of thatIt was the role of Pencils to do the first part of any work. The Pens would then trace toperfection what the Pencils had started, leaving no traces of their initial efforts. Then, the Crayonswould brighten the Pens' work, making the Pencils go unnoticed. Such was the norm where thePens and the Crayons would be in the spotlight while the Pencils would always stay on thesidelinesLittle Pencil knew the Pencil family worked hard, but he couldn't understand why they werehappy even if they were underappreciated."Mom, I don't want to be a pencil anymore," he grumbled."Dear, you need to know that we Pencils are as good as the Pens and Crayons," hismother repliedThat's clearly untrue, Mom!" Little Pencil protested."W not true, then tell me why pens need us to create perfect lines?" Mother Pencil asked.Little Pencil replied with a sigh."Pens and crayons are unable to correct their mistakes while we, pencils, can," MotherPencil continued. We don'tget recognized most of the time, but it doesn't mean we can't shine,"she explained.Little Pencil mumbled, "But pens cover our marks, and crayons make them look alive.""But we guide them, dear son," Mother Pencil countered, "they can't produce great workswithout us starting them.""And that makes you independent because you don't need help to create something,"Mother Pencil explained."Pens, crayons and pencils have their own ups and downs, and believe me when I saywe're all the same," she said. "We pencils create, so do pens and crayons. We make mistakes,so do they.""But the Pens and the Crayons would always steal the credit!" Little Pencil complained,holding back his tears."But without us, they won't shine," Mother Pencil wiped his tears away. We are asimportant as they are. There's something better than being noticed, son."Little Pencil asked, "What could be better than being noticed, Mom?""It is knowing you have a purpose and believing you are more than what you appear tobe," Mother Pencil answered."You yourself should know how important you are and how beautiful your role is in thisworld," Mother Pencil pointed out as she hugged Little Pencil. "For me, there's no better feelingthan leaming to love yourself and realizing how important you are," she stressed.Little Pencil gave a sheepish smile, all he needed was his mother's enlightening words.Never had he been proud of what he was and who he was. At last, he was ready to introducehimself to the world."Lam a pen. I make drawings pop outl" proclaimed someone from the family of pens."I am a crayon. I make these drawings colorfull" declared someone from the family ofcrayons."I am a pencil. I make those drawings happenl" asserted Little Pencil, who came from thefamily of pencilsNever had he been this prouder! ​​ ​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A boy was watching his grandmother write a letter. At one point he asked: ‘Are you writing a story about what we’ve done? Is it a story about me?’
</p><p>His grandmother stopped writing her letter and said to her grandson:
</p><p>I am writing about you, actually, but more important than the words is the pencil I’m using. I hope you will be like this pencil when you grow up.’</p><p>Intrigued, the boy looked at the pencil. It didn’t seem very special.
</p><p>‘But it’s just like any other pencil I’ve ever seen!’ ‘That depends on how you look at things. It has five qualities which, if you manage to hang on them, will make you a person who is always at peace with the world.’ ‘First quality: you are capable of great things, but you must never forget that there is a hand guiding your steps. We call that hand God, and He always guides us according to His will.’
</p><p>‘Second quality: now and then, I have to stop writing and use a sharpner. That makes the pencil suffer a little, but afterwards, he’s much sharper. So you, too, must learn to bear certain pains and sorrows, because they will make you a better person.
</p><p>‘Third quality: the pencil always allows us to use an eraser to rub out any mistakes. This means that correcting something we did is not necessarily a bad thing; it helps to keep us on the road to justice.’
</p><p>‘Fourth quality: what really matters in a pencil is not its wooden exterior, but the graphite inside. So always pay attention to what is happening inside you.’
</p><p>‘Finally, the pencil’s fifth quality: it always leaves a mark. in just the same way, you should know that everything you do in life will leave a mark, so try to be conscious of that in your every action’</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>copy paste lang po yan</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                            3. Summary of the story of the tale of the pencil ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The story of the Tale of the Pencil is about the journey of a pencil from its beginnings as a tree, to its transformation into a pencil through the process of cutting, shaping, and sharpening. The pencil reflects on its purpose and the role it plays in the lives of people, from providing a tool for students to learn and express themselves, to being a source of inspiration for artists and writers. The pencil also reflects on its own limitations, and the fact that it will eventually be worn down and discarded, but it takes solace in the fact that it has served its purpose and helped to create something beautiful. The story is a reminder of the value of hard work, dedication, and the importance of fulfilling one's purpose in life.</p><p></p>Pa Brainliest po, Thanks.<br />

where is the setting in the story?</h2><br />
                        <p>Answer:poem ‘The Pencil’s Story7, written by Florence Hoatson, is a symbolic poem, which highlights how even small things can teach us a lesson in our life. In the poem, a pencil called H and B, is narrating its own story. It is the story of the pencil’s journey from mantelpiece to the holder just as our journey beams from birth and ends with death.

                            11. what have you learned about "the story of pencil"?By Paulo CoelhoPa help po​</h2><br />
                        The Story of Pencil<p></p><p>The <strong>story of a pencil</strong> is simple at first but contains a lot of messages to get by. The following points can be learned from the story of a pencil by Paulo Coelho: </p><p></p><p><strong>1. Make corrections after learning from your mistakes.</strong></p><p>In daily life, a pencil is a helpful instrument that we use for both writing and drawing. Unintentionally making a mistake while using a pencil is possible, but there is an eraser on the pencil that you can use to correct the error and your written or drawn work. Because we are imperfect, humans make a lot of mistakes, but by learning from them, we can improve and gain wisdom. We must be able to start over after missteps and move on with our lives with a new outlook rather than letting them hold us back.</p><p></p><p><strong>2. Life must be approached firmly but without too much pressure.</strong></p><p>Whether writing or sketching, a pencil writes perfectly effectively when it is held firmly and directed. If the pencil is squeezed too hard, the tip may shatter or the pencil may split in half. The second thing we can learn from the pencil is that it's sage to approach life firmly with rules and disciplines in order to help us become valuable to both ourselves and the rest of the world. Self-imposed pressure might lead to your emotional, bodily, and spiritual collapse. As you build on the big idea, be patient and accomplish your goals one at a time.</p><p></p><p><strong>3. You'll also need polishing and sharpening.</strong></p><p>A pencil needs to be sharpened and polished in order to write clearly. Writing is improved with a sharp pointed pencil over a dull one. To create a clean, flawless drawing, an artist must ensure that their pencil is properly sharpened. As humans, we also need to be sharpened and polished to increase our value. We go through difficult times to strengthen us and get ready for bigger responsibilities in the future.</p><p></p><p><strong>4. Looks can be deceiving.</strong></p><p>Pencils are available in a range of colors and designs, depending on how the producer wants it to seem. The quality of the lead inside the pencil, not the branding, is what distinguishes it. Because humans have mastered the skill of faking, appearances can be misleading. So spend some time getting to know someone rather than a passing judgment based solely on appearance. To reach the right conclusion, understand their motivations and aspirations.</p><p></p><p><strong>5. There is a use for each type of pencil.</strong></p><p>For a variety of uses, numerous types of pencils are produced. There are pencils made for writing that write flawlessly, others made for drawing, and even another made for coloring. Each pencil performs well for its intended use.</p><p>Each of us was given a purpose when we were born as humans. Everyone possesses a quality about oneself that makes them unique. Our aim is to discover our purpose, develop as individuals, and serve the world. The article "Self Improvement is a Continuous Process" is another option.</p><p></p><p><strong>6. Everything you do leaves a trace.</strong></p><p>On a blank pad, writing with a pencil produces a mark that cannot be totally removed. It can be used to write things that unite people or things that divide them and make the world a better place. Every action we take while on this earth leaves a permanent imprint. When you treat someone kindly, it stays with them forever, just as when you treat someone badly, it stays with them forever. Our intention is to leave a fantastic lasting impression and foster happy memories.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>To know more about related the topic, visit the link below:</strong></p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/24081704 </strong></p><p><strong>#SPJ2</strong></p><p></p><br />

After reading, evaluatethe short story using the criteria below. Then, Write a brief review in the comment section.Proud Little PencilBy Joemar L. Furigay"Pencils? They're very unfortunatel" mocked those bom with the privilege of ink."They're dull, too!" mimicked those born with the privilege of color."Truly unlucky!" they chorused in derisionLittle Pencil felt depressed upon hearing what the Pens and Crayons told about themPencils. True, he came from the Pencil family, and he was bound to carry out a Pencil's job. Andhe wasn't proud of thatIt was the role of Pencils to do the first part of any work. The Pens would then trace toperfection what the Pencils had started, leaving no traces of their initial efforts. Then, the Crayonswould brighten the Pens' work, making the Pencils go unnoticed. Such was the norm where thePens and the Crayons would be in the spotlight while the Pencils would always stay on thesidelinesLittle Pencil knew the Pencil family worked hard, but he couldn't understand why they werehappy even if they were underappreciated."Mom, I don't want to be a pencil anymore," he grumbled."Dear, you need to know that we Pencils are as good as the Pens and Crayons," hismother repliedThat's clearly untrue, Mom!" Little Pencil protested."W not true, then tell me why pens need us to create perfect lines?" Mother Pencil asked.Little Pencil replied with a sigh."Pens and crayons are unable to correct their mistakes while we, pencils, can," MotherPencil continued. We don'tget recognized most of the time, but it doesn't mean we can't shine,"she explained.Little Pencil mumbled, "But pens cover our marks, and crayons make them look alive.""But we guide them, dear son," Mother Pencil countered, "they can't produce great workswithout us starting them.""And that makes you independent because you don't need help to create something,"Mother Pencil explained."Pens, crayons and pencils have their own ups and downs, and believe me when I saywe're all the same," she said. "We pencils create, so do pens and crayons. We make mistakes,so do they.""But the Pens and the Crayons would always steal the credit!" Little Pencil complained,holding back his tears."But without us, they won't shine," Mother Pencil wiped his tears away. We are asimportant as they are. There's something better than being noticed, son."Little Pencil asked, "What could be better than being noticed, Mom?""It is knowing you have a purpose and believing you are more than what you appear tobe," Mother Pencil answered."You yourself should know how important you are and how beautiful your role is in thisworld," Mother Pencil pointed out as she hugged Little Pencil. "For me, there's no better feelingthan leaming to love yourself and realizing how important you are," she stressed.Little Pencil gave a sheepish smile, all he needed was his mother's enlightening words.Never had he been proud of what he was and who he was. At last, he was ready to introducehimself to the world."Lam a pen. I make drawings pop outl" proclaimed someone from the family of pens."I am a crayon. I make these drawings colorfull" declared someone from the family ofcrayons."I am a pencil. I make those drawings happenl" asserted Little Pencil, who came from thefamily of pencilsNever had he been this prouder! ​​ ​</h2><br />
