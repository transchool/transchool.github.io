                                            The musical practices of Mindanao reflect separate Islamic and non-Islamic cultural traditions. When we talk about music, Mindanao music is characterized by a highly subtle organization of melody and rhythm. is mainly homophonic, using a clear melody line over a subordinate chordal accompaniment, but counterpoint was by no means forgotten, especially later in the period. Melisma singing, song phrases, narrow singing, fluid singing, tremolo, strained voice, nasal enunciation, these are some of the characteristics of Islamic music. We have the chants and lullabies under vocal music; the richness of his/her kulintang and bamboo ensemble, the popular solo instruments like the kudyapi, all of which are strongly influenced by Islam and its traditions. Then we have the traditions of the Christians, which now has a very wide range of ancient and modern Catholic/church music, and those non-Christians / non-Muslim’s groups’, the Lumad’s folk songs. 1.

                            7. The musical practices of Mindanao reflect separate Islamic and non-Islamic cultural traditions. When we talk about music, Mindanao music is characterized by a highly subtle organization of melody and rhythm. is mainly homophonic, using a clear melody line over a subordinate chordal accompaniment, but counterpoint was by no means forgotten, especially later in the period. Melisma singing, song phrases, narrow singing, fluid singing, tremolo, strained voice, nasal enunciation, these are some of the characteristics of Islamic music. We have the chants and lullabies under vocal music; the richness of his/her kulintang and bamboo ensemble, the popular solo instruments like the kudyapi, all of which are strongly influenced by Islam and its traditions. Then we have the traditions of the Christians, which now has a very wide range of ancient and modern Catholic/church music, and those non-Christians / non-Muslim’s groups’, the Lumad’s folk songs. 1.
