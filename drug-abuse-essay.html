I chose drugs that impact me a lot. It’s a sad fact that drugs are being abused among people not only in our country but also it is practiced by others especially the teenagers in our generation maybe because the lack of attention of parents to children or the friends were bad influence, but I believe it’s not excuse to be involved in such a situation like this.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My reflection paper is on the subject of substance abuse.  As the structure of society changes, the acceptability of one drug or another changes.  I have dealt with my own experiences of substance abuse personally and through family and friends throughout my community.  I believe there are many underlying problems Native people face today that lead to substance abuse.  So, drug use and alcoholism is not the problem in my town, those are more like side effects of something deeper.  I would have to agree most with the symbolic interactionist perspective as far as the labeling theory goes.  There are also many images in the media that depict the use of drugs and alcohol to make it seem like even though it is bad, it is sometimes okay.  These images sparked my own curiosity to experience a fun high or a night out with friends and hopefully getting lucky.  I had so many questions about drug use and alcohol.  My older siblings and cousins were involved in those circles so it was only natural that me and my cousins and peers who I grew up with got into smoking marijuana and buying drinks on the weekends.  I did not know at the time about the dangers of underage drinking.  I also had very little knowledge of the condition of my mental health at my young age.  Eventually I found out that I had an addictive personality and I got myself into a downward spiral of substance abuse. My drug of choice is marijuana.  Some people say marijuana is not a drug.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p></p><p></p><p>Dug Abuse Essay</p><p></p><p>A drug is a substance which may have medicinal, intoxicating, performance enhancing or other effects when taken or put into a human body or the body of another animal and is not considered a food or exclusively a food. I chose drugs that impact me a lot. It’s a sad fact that drugs are being abused among people not only in our country but also it is practiced by others especially the teenagers in our generation maybe because the lack of attention of parents to children or the friends were bad influence, but I believe it’s not excuse to be involved in such a situation like this.</p><p></p><p>Prevention Of Drug Abuse In Schools Essay</p><p></p><p>It is the choice of an individual whether he/she will be influenced by or follow what others do to make their lives miserable. Drug abuse is what I would consider a pretty severe problem we have here in the Philippines. There are many different types of drugs such as marijuana, cocaine, ecstasy, and heroine to just list a few. These drugs are all fairly simple to produce.</p><p></p><p>Teenage drug abuse</p><p></p><p>Teenagers use drugs because they want to fit in. No one wants to be the only one not participating. No one wants to be left out.</p><p>So sometimes they make bad decisions, like taking drugs, to cover-up their insecurities. * Because they want to escape or relax. * Because they think it makes them seem grown-up. * Because they want to rebel. Sometimes people turn to drugs not so much for themselves, but to make a statement against someone else, such as their families or society in general. * Because they are curious. Adolescents are curious about having new experiences. Seeing someone doing drugs makes them more curious to know how drugs will make them feel.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Ways to prevent drug abuse</p><p></p><p>The reasons above should never be an excuse to abuse ourselves. While it’s practically impossible to prevent anyone and everyone from using drugs, there are things we can all do to avoid drug and/or alcohol abuse. By sharing this knowledge with those closest to you, you yourself may be able to prevent them from doing drugs, too. Good communication with all family members, especially with our parents would be one of the effective ways for us not to sort on taking drugs when it comes to dealing with our problems.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Answer:</p><p></p><p>- Drugs are nothing but certain substances that make you addicted to them and change your lifestyle. The change that comes within your lifestyle is mostly negative. It is known to alter reality in such a way that you forget your roots and become prone to succumbing to your bad habits. The main change comes into your mental and physical wellbeing. This gives way to financial problems and negative effects on family and even professional relationships.</p><p></p><p>Drugs are not to be taken lightly as a problem. They are something that is often taken lightly and are taken within but is soon found to be irreparable mistakes. Drug use is mostly opted for when you are trying to cope up in a situation where you are emotionally tired and you feel that taking drugs would free you of the pain. This is the reason why most of the young generation falls prey to this demon.</p><p></p><p>Drug abuse is the most problematic cause of death in the world. Around 350,000 die from overdoses of smoking, drugs, and drinking as well. It is high time that we understand the seriousness of drug abuse and stay as far as possible from it.</p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p>Sana makatulong. Hihi❣</p><br />

                            25. ESSAY:What are the causes of drug use and abuse?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Drug abuse is the use of illegal drugs or the use of prescription or over-the-counter medications in ways other than recommended or intended. It also includes intentional inhalation of household or industrial chemicals for their mind-altering effects. Tobacco use and problem drinking are sometimes included in the definition of drug abuse. Chemical abuse and substance abuse are terms sometimes used interchangeably with the term drug abuse, or they may be used to refer to a combination of drug abuse and tobacco use or problem drinking.</p><p></p><p>Many drugs that are abused are also addictive; they cause cravings and a continued desire to use them despite negative consequences. Drug abuse can start in childhood and continue in adulthood. Studies of high school students indicate that approximately 42% drink alcohol, 21% use marijuana, and 3% use cocaine. Approximately 12% have used inhalants, and 20% have abused prescription drugs (Source: CDC).</p><p></p><p>People who abuse drugs may take them initially out of curiosity, to escape, to feel good, due to peer pressure, or for a variety of other reasons. Drugs can affect a number of different organs, and complications can result from damage to the brain or to other parts of the body. Other negative consequences often result from the effects drugs have on a person’s mind, as well as actions an individual may take while under their influence.</p><p></p><p>Treatment can be on an inpatient or outpatient basis, depending on the drug being abused, whether addiction is present, and whether there are coexisting health or psychological problems. Supervised withdrawal, also called detoxification (or detox), may be necessary if physical symptoms are common when the drug is stopped. Medications may be used to decrease cravings, cou nteract the effects of the drug, or to cause unpleasant reactions if the drug is used. Behavioral therapy is commonly an important part of treatment, providing skills, helping change attitudes and behaviors, and helping maintain recovery.</p><p></p><p>Drug abuse can have serious, even life-threatening, complications, such as drug overdose, alcohol poisoning, trauma, and suicidal or violent behavior. Seek immediate medical care (call 911) for serious symptoms, including threatening, irrational or suicidal behavior; serious injury; respiratory or breathing problems; rapid, slow or absent pulse; chest pain or tightness; persistent vomiting; cold, clammy, or hot, dry skin; severe abdominal pain; seizure; or confusion or loss of consciousness for even a brief moment.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It has been discovered that most people who struggle with drug addiction began experimenting with drugs in their teens.  Teenage drug abuse is one of the largest problems in society today and the problem grows and larger every year.  Drugs are a pervasive force in our culture today.  To expect kids not to be influenced by the culture of their time is as unrealistic as believing in the tooth fairy (Bauman 140).  Teens may feel pressured by their friends to try drugs, they may have easy access to drugs, they may use drugs to rebel against their family or society, or they may take an illegal drug because they are curious about it or the pleasure that it gives them. After interviewing my teenage cousin whom has been in several altercations.</p><p>My teenage cousin advised me that after she passed the stage of being pressured by her peers to use drugs and alcohol, she began using it to make her feel better because she was suffering from depression.  Depression is the result of chemical imbalance and environmental influence.  Drugs and alcohol are the most readily available methods of emotional anesthesia, if not on hand; they would find a substitute (Henican 141).  She would use drugs when she would think about her incarcerated dad that has been in and out of her life from birth.  Her family members would try to encourage her and would often tell her, “If you continue to do the things that you are doing, you will end up like your dad incarcerated.”  She rebels against her mother and stepfather when they try to correct her and discipline her.  She doesn’t like to follow the rules at home or school and acts like she doesn’t do anything wrong.  Something psychologically is really going on with her mentally, that is one of the side effects that drugs causes.  Seeing there is no way out feeling lonely like no one cares and no prospects for improvement leads to depression.  Depression is something that many teens deal with during their lives.</p><p></p><br />
