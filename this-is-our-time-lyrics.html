Our National Anthem 
 Our national anthem was first publicly played on June 12, 1898 as the Filipino flag was being raised during the proclamation of the Philippine Independence by Gen. Aguinaldo. When it was composed by Julian Felipe, there were no words yet to the hymn. 
 On September 3, 1899, Jose Palma's lyrics in Spanish was first published and it was instantly accepted as fitting lyrics to the hymn. In 1916, English was declared the official language in government offices and schools; so the Spanish lyrics had to be changed to English. A literal translation was made by Martha Lane, an American schoolteacher who collaborated with Camilo Osias. This became for a time the official version of our national anthem. 
 After the proclamation of Independence in 1946, it became a necessary to have a version in Filipino. Finally, in 1956, a stirring lyric in Filipino was approved and won public acceptance. The Filipino National Anthem has remained unchanged since then.</a>

Our National Anthem 
 Our national anthem was first publicly played on June 12, 1898 as the Filipino flag was being raised during the proclamation of the Philippine Independence by Gen. Aguinaldo. When it was composed by Julian Felipe, there were no words yet to the hymn. 
 On September 3, 1899, Jose Palma's lyrics in Spanish was first published and it was instantly accepted as fitting lyrics to the hymn. In 1916, English was declared the official language in government offices and schools; so the Spanish lyrics had to be changed to English. A literal translation was made by Martha Lane, an American schoolteacher who collaborated with Camilo Osias. This became for a time the official version of our national anthem. 
 After the proclamation of Independence in 1946, it became a necessary to have a version in Filipino. Finally, in 1956, a stirring lyric in Filipino was approved and won public acceptance. The Filipino National Anthem has remained unchanged since then.</h2><br />
