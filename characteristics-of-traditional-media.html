                        <br /><br />TRADITIONAL MEDIA, or as some refer to as old media, has been used in the marketing/advertising world for years. When related to advertising, traditional media encompasses that of television, newspaper, radio and magazine ads. <br /><br />These forms of communication are the steadfast ways that businesses have reached both consumers and other companies for decades. <br /><br />They are the roots of advertising and the most common form utilized by businesses on a daily basis. Though traditional media is effective, over the course of the last few years we have seen more and more businesses utilizing new media to reach its target audiences.<br /><br />while NEW MEDIA is..the future of advertising. More and more consumers and businesses rely on new media to find their information. Ultimately, new media refers to content that is easily accessible via many different forms of digital media. <br /><br />When related to advertising, some examples of new media include online advertising (retargeting, banner ads, etc.), online streaming (radio and television) and social media advertising. Each of these are means in which businesses have the capability to reach consumers and other businesses with ease.<br /><br /><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Neoclassical art, also called Neoclassicism and Classicism, a widespread and influential movement in painting and the other visual arts that began in the 1760s, reached its height in the 1780s and ’90s, and lasted until the 1840s and ’50s. In painting it generally took the form of an emphasis on austere linear design in the depiction of Classical themes and subject matter, using archaeologically correct settings and clothing. Neoclassicism in the arts is an aesthetic attitude based on the art of Greece and Rome in antiquity, which invokes harmony, clarity, restraint, universality, and idealism. In the context of the tradition, Classicism refers either to the art produced in antiquity or to later art inspired by that of antiquity, while Neoclassicism always refers to the art produced later but inspired by antiquity. Classicizing artists tend to prefer somewhat more specific qualities, which include line over colour, straight lines over curves, frontality and closed compositions over diagonal compositions into deep space, and the general over the particular.</p><p></p><p>Neoclassicism arose partly as a reaction against the sensuous and frivolously decorative Rococo style that had dominated European art from the 1720s on. But an even more profound stimulus was the new and more scientific interest in Classical antiquity that arose in the 18th century. Neoclassicism was given great impetus by new archaeological discoveries, particularly the exploration and excavation of the buried Roman cities of Herculaneum and Pompeii (the excavations of which began in 1738 and 1748, respectively). And, from the second decade of the 18th century on, a number of influential publications by Bernard de Montfaucon, Giovanni Battista Piranesi, the comte de Caylus, and antiquarian Robert Wood provided engraved views of Roman monuments and other antiquities and further quickened interest in the Classical past. The new understanding distilled from these discoveries and publications in turn enabled European scholars for the first time to discern separate and distinct chronological periods in Greco-Roman art, and this new sense of a plurality of ancient styles replaced the older, unqualified veneration of Roman art and encouraged a dawning interest in purely Greek antiquities. The German scholar Johann Joachim Winckelmann’s writings and sophisticated theorizings were especially influential in this regard. Winckelmann saw in Greek sculpture “a noble simplicity and quiet grandeur” and called for artists to imitate Greek art. He claimed that in doing so such artists would obtain idealized depictions of natural forms that had been stripped of all transitory and individualistic aspects, and their images would thus attain a universal and archetypal significance.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Brainliest please</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>The ingenuity behind the parol making was done by recycled materials like plastic bottles, soda can, spoon and fork etc.</p><p>Recycled Spoon Source Source Made from Tahong Sea Shell &amp; Bottle Caps Source PET Bottles and Soda Can image credits Plastic Bottles and Car Tire image credits Plastic Spoon and Fork image credits</p><p></p>Recycling Conserves Resources<p>When we recycle, used materials are converted into new products, reducing the need to consume natural resources. If used materials are not recycled, new products are made by extracting fresh, raw material from the Earth, through mining and forestry. Recycling helps conserve important raw materials and protects natural habitats for the future.</p><p></p>Recycling saves energy<p>Using recycled materials in the manufacturing process uses considerably less energy than that required for producing new products from raw materials – even when comparing all associated costs including transport etc. Plus there are extra energy savings because more energy is required to extract, refine, transport and process raw materials ready for industry compared with providing industry-ready materials.</p><p></p>Recycling helps protect the environment<p>Recycling reduces the need for extracting (mining, quarrying and logging), refining and processing raw materials all of which create substantial air and water pollution. As recycling saves energy it also reduces greenhouse gas emissions, which helps to tackle climate change. Current UK recycling is estimated to save more than 18 million tonnes of CO2 a year – the equivalent to taking 5 million cars off the road.</p><p></p>Recycling reduces landfill<p>When we recycle, recyclable materials are reprocessed into new products, and as a result the amount of rubbish sent to landfill sites reduces. There are over 1,500 landfill sites in the UK, and in 2001, these sites produced a quarter of the UK’s emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><strong>MIMAROPA</strong><strong>A.	Festivals:</strong><strong>The most famous festival in MIMAROPA region is probably the one from Marinduque. It is called as The Moriones festival. The Moriones is a lenten festival held annually on Holy Week on the island of Marinduque, Philippines. It is a colorful festival celebrated on the island of Marinduque in the Philippines. The participants use morion masks to depict the Roman soldiers and Syrian mercenaries within the story of the Passion of the Christ.</strong><strong>Mindoro also hold a very vibrant festival called Dugoy festival.</strong><strong>The origin of these festivals are mostly drawn from biblical narratives or from Christian history.  </strong><strong>b. Architecture</strong><strong>Peripheral Baroque is the type of architecture that can be assessed all over the region.</strong><p><strong>VISAYAS</strong></p><strong>A.	Festivals</strong><strong>Visayas Islands is peppered with lots of vibrant festivals. Namely; Ati-atihan Festival (January), Dinagyang Festival (January), Sinulog Festival (January), Pintados Festival (June), MassKara Festival (October). The festivals mostly root from native Filipino culture of pre-colonial rituals.  </strong><strong>b. Architecture</strong><strong>Visayas is where Christianity began so it is not a surprise that the architecture, especially churches, are of Baroque styles. Baroque styles of architecture are religious. Some provinces like Cebu, Ilo-ilo,Bohol and Negros are growing to be industrialized, competing against the National Capital region, architectures will tend to be modern.  </strong><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><strong>Explanation:</strong><strong>"Correct me if Im" wrong Hope It's help!...</strong><br />
