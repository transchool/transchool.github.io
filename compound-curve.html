Inclination Joint Pillar Base</p><p>7. • Arm/Neck –Curved/slanted part which is held while carrying the microscope • Stage –Platform where object to be examined is placed • Stage Clips –Secures the specimen to the stage</p><p>8. • Stage Opening • Body Tube –Attached to the arm and bears the lenses • Draw Tube –Cylindrical structure on top of the body tube that holds the ocular lenses</p><p>9. Draw Tube Body Tube Arm / Neck Stage</p><p>10. • Revolving/Rotating Nosepiece –Rotating disc where the objectives are attached • Dust Shield –Lies atop the nosepiece and keeps dust from settling on the objectives</p><p>11. Dust Shield Revolving Nosepiece</p><p>12. • Coarse Adjustment Knob –Geared to the body tube which elevates or lowers when rotated bringing the object into approximate focus • Fine Adjustment Knob –A smaller knob for delicate focusing bringing the object into perfect focus</p><p>13. Coarse Adjustment Knob Fine Adjustment Knob</p><p>14. • Condenser Adjustment Knob –Elevates and lowers the condenser to regulate the intensity of light • Iris Diaphragm Lever –Lever in front of the condenser and which is moved horizontally to open/close the diaphragm</p><p>15. Iris Diaphragm Lever Condenser Adjustment Knob</p><p>16.

                        <p><strong>Parts of the Microscope</strong></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The compound microscope is classified into three main parts. Mechanical, illuminating, and magnifying. The mechanical part comprises of <strong>(1) draw tube</strong> which holds the objectives and revolving nosepiece in place. The coarse adjustment knob allows the movement of the tube upward or downward. On the other hand, the <strong>(2) fine adjustment knob</strong> brings the specimen into sharper focus. In addition, the stage and stage clips <strong>(3) controls </strong>and holds the specimen in place. Further, <strong>(4) base</strong> provides <strong>(5) support</strong> to the compound microscope while the <strong>(6) arm </strong>is curved shape used for holding the compound microscope when transporting. The <strong>(7) inclination joint</strong> supports the compound microscope when it is in inclined position. The illuminating part consists of the <strong>(8) mirror</strong> which allows light to pass. </p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Viewing microscopic objects is made possible because of the invention of the microscope. It allows us to observe microscopic objects that are not seen by the naked eye. In fact, several discoveries and additional knowledge have been added because of the microscope. </p><p></p><p><strong>Magnifying Parts:</strong></p><p>The microscope contains the eyepiece and objectives. These parts have lenses that help in magnifying objects or specimen being viewed. The magnifying capacity of these parts vary and this can be usually engraved on the part.</p><p></p><p><strong>Illuminating Parts</strong></p><p>The mirror or light source provides light that allows us to see the specimen we are trying to view and examine. The mirror gathers light from the light source to direct it to the specimen being viewed. The condenser focuses light entering. They collect the light and direct it to the specimen.</p><p></p><p><strong>Mechanical Parts</strong></p><p>For support, there is the base, arm, body tube, stage, and stage clips. The coarse adjustment knob and fine adjustment knob focus and sharpen the image viewed. The nosepiece is connected to the body tube and moves or shifts from one objectives lens to another objective. The diaphragm controls the amount of light reaching the specimen. Also, the inclination joint helps in adjusting the tilt of the microscope. These parts all help in the function of the microscope which to magnify and view microscopic objects.</p><p></p><p>#BRAINLYFAST</p><p></p><p></p><br />
