                                            My infatuation with the study of animate nature grew rapidly into a full-fledged love affair. I found that even the human beings with whom the study brought me into contact could be fascinating too. My first mentor was a middle-aged Scotsman who gained his livelihood delivering ice, but who was in fact an ardent amateur mammologist. At a tender age he had developed mange, or leprosy, or some other such infantile disease, and had lost all his hair, never to recover it - a tragedy which may have had a bearing on the fact that, when I knew him, he had already devoted fifteen years of his life to a study of the relationship between summer molt and incipient narcissism in pocket gophers. This man had become so intimate with gophers that he could charm them with sibilant whistles until they would emerge from their underground retreats and passively allow him to examine the hair on their backs. Nor were the professional biologists with whom I later came into contact one whit less interesting. When I was eighteen I spent a summer doing field work in the company of another mammologist, seventy years of age, who was replete with degrees and whose towering stature in the world of science had been earned largely by an exhaustive study of uterine scars in shrews. This man, a revered professor at a large American university, knew more about the uteri of shrews than any other man has ever known. Furthermore, he could talk about his subject with real enthusiasm. Death will find me long before I tire of contemplating an evening spent in his company during which he enthralled a mixed audience consisting of a fur trader, a Cree Indian matron, and an Anglican missionary, with an hour-long monologue on sexual aberrations in female pygmy shrews. (The trader misconstrued the tenor of the discourse; but the missionary, inured by years of humorless dissertations, soon put him right.) My early years as a naturalist were free and fascinating, but as I entered manhood and found that my avocation must now become my vocation, the walls began to close in. The happy days of the universal scholar who was able to take a keen interest in all phases of natural history were at an end, and I was forced to recognize the unpalatable necessity of specializing, if I was to succeed as a professional biologist. Nevertheless, as I began my academic training at the university, I found it difficult to choose the narrow path.

                                            Decide on your stand. After studying the informed opinion, it is time for you to decide whether to agree or disagree with the author's statements. Your decision will depend on your judgement, feelings, or even from your personal experiences about the topic. However, you must remember that though you are free to choose a stand, the proofs or facts you have gathered must always be your bases in making a stand. The sample flowchart below will guide you in deciding on your stand: Start No Study the informed opinion Owning a pet reduces stress. Do you agree? No Yes Do you have basis to support your judgement? List down basis/facts supporting your stand: 1. Personal experience 2. Testimonies from pet owners 3. Published scientific claims Yes 3 4 Present your stand. State your opinion based on your stand on the topic. Explain why you agreed or disagreed with the informed opinion that was presented. Enumerate your reasons to support your point of view. Study the example below: a. Your opinion: I agree that owning a pet reduces stress. b. Reasons: I am a pet owner too and I have experienced it. I felt lonely during the series of lockdowns brought about by the pandemic. I missed playing with my friends outside. I am glad that whenever I feel sad, my pet cat would always brush her body on my legs. It tickles and makes me laugh. She always cheers me up. Truly, having pets makes you happy! Provide evidence. Support your stand with pieces of evidence you have gathered. Present facts, proofs, and bases to show that you are certain about the side that you have taken. I have gathered testimonies from my friends. We all have the same experience. Our pets uplift our mood and keep away the stress we feel. According to an article from HelpGuide.org, pets, especially dogs and cats, can reduce stress, anxiety, and depression, ease loneliness, encourage exercise and playfulness, and even improve your cardiovascular health.​</a>

It is also a reminder not use or devices on top of scaffolds to increase the height. Never place scaffolds on surface where loose objects could tip, break, or become dislodged. Install mid-rails, and toe-boards at all openings, open sides, and ends of every work platform Inspect the assembled scaffolds in order to maintain the safe condition of the scaffold. Never allow quantities of components to stock piled on partially completed scaffolds.

                                            My infatuation with the study of animate nature grew rapidly into a full-fledged love affair. I found that even the human beings with whom the study brought me into contact could be fascinating too. My first mentor was a middle-aged Scotsman who gained his livelihood delivering ice, but who was in fact an ardent amateur mammologist. At a tender age he had developed mange, or leprosy, or some other such infantile disease, and had lost all his hair, never to recover it-a tragedy which may have had a bearing on the fact that, when I knew him, he had already devoted fifteen years of his life to a study of the relationship between summer molt and incipient narcissism in pocket gophers. This man had become so intimate with gophers that he could charm them with sibilant whistles until they would emerge from their underground retreats and passively allow him to examine the hair on their backs. Nor were the professional biologists with whom I later came into contact one whit less interesting. When I was eighteen I spent a summer doing field work in the company of another mammologist, seventy years of age, who was replete with degrees and whose towering stature in the world of science had been earned largely by an exhaustive study of uterine scars in shrews. This man, a revered professor at a large American university. knew more about the uteri of shrews than any other man has ever known. Furthermore, he could talk about his subject with real enthusiasm. Death will find me long before I tire of contemplating an evening spent in his company during which he enthralled a mixed audience consisting of a fur trader, a Cree Indian matron, and an Anglican missionary. with an hour-long monologue on sexual aberrations in female pygmy shrews. (The trader misconstrued the tenor of the discourse; but the missionary, inured by years of humorless dissertations, soon put him right.) My early years as a naturalist were free and fascinating, but as I entered manhood and found that my avocation must now become my vocation, the walls began to close in. The happy days of the universal scholar who was able to take a keen interest in all phases of natural history were at an end, and I was forced to recognize the unpalatable necessity of specializing, if I was to succeed as a professional biologist. Nevertheless, as I began my academic training at the university, I found it difficult to choose the narrow path.  1. What is the author's present situation? A. He is a biologist. B. He is an intern.

                                            Portfolio Output 1: "My Diary” Instruction: During these pandemic times, I have actively volunteered in some non-profit organizations to help people, specifically in checking their mental health by providing tele-counseling while they are experiencing quarantine. Às many of my clients encounter new experiences." ivost of them do experience changes in their views, beliefs, including the stress that piles up in their head. In our non-profit organization, we tend to provide our digital consumers ways to cope with this "new normal” in our society. One of which is keeping a simple diary. During the time of Sigmund Freud (1944), keeping a Diary is one of the oldest methods for collecting data about the individual's personality. In my field as a practicing psychologist, I sometimes suggest that my students have a personal diary to record their behavior, thinking, and experiences, no matter how absurd their experiences are. In this way, I let my students be aware of their surroundings, their decisions and themselves. As our lesson implies, knowing the "selt" starts when we exercise the awareness of our identity. In this portfolio, you are tasked to have your own simple personal diary. Below is a format that you should follow to start the daily writing/recording of your diary. Your front cover may be a reflection of what you want to be. In doing so, you are free to create your own front cover. You may use any available writing material for this. This personal diary is to be sustained until the end of the subject course. Also, this must be submitted on the last day of the semester as one of the prerequisites in passing the subject.​</a>

                            6. My infatuation with the study of animate nature grew rapidly into a full-fledged love affair. I found that even the human beings with whom the study brought me into contact could be fascinating too. My first mentor was a middle-aged Scotsman who gained his livelihood delivering ice, but who was in fact an ardent amateur mammologist. At a tender age he had developed mange, or leprosy, or some other such infantile disease, and had lost all his hair, never to recover it - a tragedy which may have had a bearing on the fact that, when I knew him, he had already devoted fifteen years of his life to a study of the relationship between summer molt and incipient narcissism in pocket gophers. This man had become so intimate with gophers that he could charm them with sibilant whistles until they would emerge from their underground retreats and passively allow him to examine the hair on their backs. Nor were the professional biologists with whom I later came into contact one whit less interesting. When I was eighteen I spent a summer doing field work in the company of another mammologist, seventy years of age, who was replete with degrees and whose towering stature in the world of science had been earned largely by an exhaustive study of uterine scars in shrews. This man, a revered professor at a large American university, knew more about the uteri of shrews than any other man has ever known. Furthermore, he could talk about his subject with real enthusiasm. Death will find me long before I tire of contemplating an evening spent in his company during which he enthralled a mixed audience consisting of a fur trader, a Cree Indian matron, and an Anglican missionary, with an hour-long monologue on sexual aberrations in female pygmy shrews. (The trader misconstrued the tenor of the discourse; but the missionary, inured by years of humorless dissertations, soon put him right.) My early years as a naturalist were free and fascinating, but as I entered manhood and found that my avocation must now become my vocation, the walls began to close in. The happy days of the universal scholar who was able to take a keen interest in all phases of natural history were at an end, and I was forced to recognize the unpalatable necessity of specializing, if I was to succeed as a professional biologist.

                            15. Decide on your stand. After studying the informed opinion, it is time for you to decide whether to agree or disagree with the author's statements. Your decision will depend on your judgement, feelings, or even from your personal experiences about the topic. However, you must remember that though you are free to choose a stand, the proofs or facts you have gathered must always be your bases in making a stand. The sample flowchart below will guide you in deciding on your stand: Start No Study the informed opinion Owning a pet reduces stress. Do you agree? No Yes Do you have basis to support your judgement? List down basis/facts supporting your stand: 1. Personal experience 2. Testimonies from pet owners 3. Published scientific claims Yes 3 4 Present your stand. State your opinion based on your stand on the topic. Explain why you agreed or disagreed with the informed opinion that was presented. Enumerate your reasons to support your point of view. Study the example below: a. Your opinion: I agree that owning a pet reduces stress. b. Reasons: I am a pet owner too and I have experienced it. I felt lonely during the series of lockdowns brought about by the pandemic. I missed playing with my friends outside. I am glad that whenever I feel sad, my pet cat would always brush her body on my legs. It tickles and makes me laugh. She always cheers me up. Truly, having pets makes you happy! Provide evidence. Support your stand with pieces of evidence you have gathered. Present facts, proofs, and bases to show that you are certain about the side that you have taken. I have gathered testimonies from my friends. We all have the same experience. Our pets uplift our mood and keep away the stress we feel. According to an article from HelpGuide.org, pets, especially dogs and cats, can reduce stress, anxiety, and depression, ease loneliness, encourage exercise and playfulness, and even improve your cardiovascular health.​</h2><br />

                            19. My infatuation with the study of animate nature grew rapidly into a full-fledged love affair. I found that even the human beings with whom the study brought me into contact could be fascinating too. My first mentor was a middle-aged Scotsman who gained his livelihood delivering ice, but who was in fact an ardent amateur mammologist. At a tender age he had developed mange, or leprosy, or some other such infantile disease, and had lost all his hair, never to recover it-a tragedy which may have had a bearing on the fact that, when I knew him, he had already devoted fifteen years of his life to a study of the relationship between summer molt and incipient narcissism in pocket gophers. This man had become so intimate with gophers that he could charm them with sibilant whistles until they would emerge from their underground retreats and passively allow him to examine the hair on their backs. Nor were the professional biologists with whom I later came into contact one whit less interesting. When I was eighteen I spent a summer doing field work in the company of another mammologist, seventy years of age, who was replete with degrees and whose towering stature in the world of science had been earned largely by an exhaustive study of uterine scars in shrews. This man, a revered professor at a large American university. knew more about the uteri of shrews than any other man has ever known. Furthermore, he could talk about his subject with real enthusiasm. Death will find me long before I tire of contemplating an evening spent in his company during which he enthralled a mixed audience consisting of a fur trader, a Cree Indian matron, and an Anglican missionary. with an hour-long monologue on sexual aberrations in female pygmy shrews. (The trader misconstrued the tenor of the discourse; but the missionary, inured by years of humorless dissertations, soon put him right.) My early years as a naturalist were free and fascinating, but as I entered manhood and found that my avocation must now become my vocation, the walls began to close in. The happy days of the universal scholar who was able to take a keen interest in all phases of natural history were at an end, and I was forced to recognize the unpalatable necessity of specializing, if I was to succeed as a professional biologist.

                            24. Portfolio Output 1: "My Diary” Instruction: During these pandemic times, I have actively volunteered in some non-profit organizations to help people, specifically in checking their mental health by providing tele-counseling while they are experiencing quarantine. Às many of my clients encounter new experiences." ivost of them do experience changes in their views, beliefs, including the stress that piles up in their head. In our non-profit organization, we tend to provide our digital consumers ways to cope with this "new normal” in our society. One of which is keeping a simple diary. During the time of Sigmund Freud (1944), keeping a Diary is one of the oldest methods for collecting data about the individual's personality. In my field as a practicing psychologist, I sometimes suggest that my students have a personal diary to record their behavior, thinking, and experiences, no matter how absurd their experiences are. In this way, I let my students be aware of their surroundings, their decisions and themselves. As our lesson implies, knowing the "selt" starts when we exercise the awareness of our identity. In this portfolio, you are tasked to have your own simple personal diary. Below is a format that you should follow to start the daily writing/recording of your diary. Your front cover may be a reflection of what you want to be. In doing so, you are free to create your own front cover. You may use any available writing material for this. This personal diary is to be sustained until the end of the subject course. Also, this must be submitted on the last day of the semester as one of the prerequisites in passing the subject.​</h2><br />
