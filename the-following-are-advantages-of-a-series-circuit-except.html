</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p>Advantages:<strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p>The amount of electricity distributed from one unit to another is equal.
When installed properly, they could have individual or separate switches.
You can add more components without changing the voltage. It only means that the voltage from the source would still be the same.
The layout is very simple and easy to assemble.<p><strong>
</strong></p><p>Disadvantages:  <strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p>Since the same amount of voltage is being distributed, it could increase the overall electricity bill.
There is a split of sources across the system so a lower resistance could happen and this type of circuit cannot be used effectively.
Most of the wirings inside the house use parallel connections and they require a lot of wires.<p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Series Connection
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p>Advantages:  <strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p>Electricity is distributed and not multiplied. The units do not overheat easily since the amount of power from the source decreases as the number of units is added.
It is easy to repair damaged units in a series connection because their layout is simple.
We can also add more power devices and they will have a higher output in terms of voltage.<p><strong>
</strong></p><p>Disadvantages:<strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p>If one unit breaks or gets damaged, the whole connection will be affected.
The more units in the connection, the greater will be the circuit resistance.<p><strong>
