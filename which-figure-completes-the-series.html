                                            Analogy is a powerful tool which challenges and encourages you tothink critically it is a strong device used to show connections andcomparisons between unlike things which highlight how they are alike(Berbacene, 2010).Oral language development lays the foundation for the skills in readingand writing. These skills will be developed later as you progress throughschool. Solid foundation In oral language will help you become a successfulreader and strong communicator, It also boosts your confidence and overallsense of well-being.After working on this module, you will be able to supply appropriateterms to complete an analogous series of words or expressions, specifically,you will be able to:1. define analogy2. determine the relationship of a given set of words in analogy:3. compare traits of characters in the story read using analogy, and4. supply terms to complete analogous series of words based on sentenceform, analogous palr and figurative analogy​</a>

                                            PRACTICE TASK 3 Read the article below before you proceed to the task. Pablo Picasso is recognized as one of the most important figures in 20th century western art He created more than 20,000 artworks in a variety of media including painting, sculpture, printmaking, drawing and ceramics Picasso showed an early talent for art and made lifelike portraits as a teenager. However, after settling in Paris in his early twenties he adopted more modern approaches to making art Between 1908 and 1911 he and fellow artist Georges Braque 'invented' a style called Cubism which took a radical, new approach to the representation of space and form In 1937, Picasso completed his iconic mural Guernica, a chilling depiction of the bombing of the Basque town of Guernica during the Spanish civil war, which resulted in the slaughter of many defenseless civilians Picasso painted Weeping Woman in October 1937 only a few months after he completed the mural It is one of a series of images of weeping women that have been linked to the figure of a grieving mother in Guernica who clasps her dead child to her chest. Weeping Woman is an iconic image of unspeakable grief and pain, representing universal suffering The fragmented features and the use of acid green and purple heighten the painting's emotional intensity The model for the Weeping Woman was Picasso's partner Dora Maar, a passionate, strong, and intelligent woman. The painting is also often seen as reflecting their complex and often stormy relationship. Directions: After reading the article, you are now tasked to write a review/critique on the painting by Pablo Picasso, "The Weeping Woman". Take note of the guidelines discussed in the introductory concept Also, you can make use of your outline on practice task 1 as your guide in this task. You may use a separate sheet of paper for your output.​</a>

                                            Hormones regulating the female reproductive systemGonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is produced by a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. When it circulates in the blood, it causes the release of two important hormones (see below, and Figure 4.1) from the pituitary gland in another specialised part of the brain.Gonadotropin is pronounced ‘gonn add oh troh pinn’. Hypothalamus is pronounced ‘hy poh thah lah mooss’. Pituitary is pronounced ‘pitt yoo itt ary’.Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is produced by the pituitary gland during the first half of the menstrual cycle. It stimulates development of the maturing ovarian follicle and controls ovum production in the female, and sperm production in the male.Leutenizing hormone (LH) is also produced by the pituitary gland in the brain. It stimulates the ovaries to produce estrogen and progesterone. It triggers ovulation (the release of a mature ovum from the ovary), and it promotes the development of the corpus luteum.Estrogen is a female reproductive hormone, produced primarily by the ovaries in the non-pregnant woman. It promotes the maturation and release of an ovum in every menstrual cycle. It is also produced by the placenta during pregnancy.Progesterone is produced by the corpus luteum in the ovary; its function is to prepare the endometrium (lining of the uterus) for the reception and development of the fertilized ovum. It also suppresses the production of estrogen after ovulation has occurred.The ovarian cycle refers to the monthly series of events in the ovaries, associated with the maturation and release of an ovum, and the ‘just in case’ preparation for its fertilization and implantation in the uterus. The ovarian cycle consists of two consecutive phases, each of about 14 days’ duration. Events are measured from ‘day 1’, which is the first day of the last normal menstrual period (LNMP).The follicular phase: days 1 to 14The sequence shown in Figure above begins with the secretion of GnRH from the hypothalamus, which stimulates the pituitary gland to produce FSH and LH, which in turn act on the ovaries, telling the ovarian follicles to complete the maturation of an ovum. During this period, a few ovarian follicles containing immature ova develop and mature under the stimulation of FSH and LH. Usually by day 14, only one follicle has become fully mature, and the ovum it contains is ready to be released. All other follicles that had begun maturing during this phase of the ovarian cycle degenerate as soon as ovulation has occurred. Note that only one-time interval is fairly constant in all females — the time from ovulation to the beginning of menstruation, which is almost always 14 to15 days. However, the time of ovulation is variable and difficult to predict accurately.The luteal phase: days 15 to 28This phase is the period of corpus luteum activity, during which the uterus is prepared ‘just in case’ of pregnancy. After ovulation has occurred, the corpus luteum begins to secrete progesterone, as well as a small amount of estrogen. Progesterone maintains the uterus in a state ready to receive and nourish an embryo. The lining of the uterus (the endometrium) becomes thicker, more richly nourished by blood vessels, and more receptive to the fertilized ovum. Progesterone also inhibits any further release of FSH or LH from the pituitary gland.Thus, ovulation is quickly followed by a rise in the level of progesterone in the circulation, as the corpus luteum takes over the production of this hormone. As the progesterone level rises, it circulates around the body in the blood. When a high concentration of progesterone reaches the hypothalamus in the brain, the lect is to stop the hypothalamus from producing GnRH.QUESTIONS:1. What will happen when the hypothalamus stops producing GnRH? 2. What ffect will this have on the ovaries?​</a>

Pablo Picasso is recognized as one of the most important figures in 20th century western art He created more than 20,000 artworks in a variety of media including painting, sculpture, printmaking, drawing and ceramics Picasso showed an early talent for art and made lifelike portraits as a teenager. However, after settling in Paris in his early twenties he adopted more modern approaches to making art Between 1908 and 1911 he and fellow artist Georges Braque 'invented' a style called Cubism which took a radical, new approach to the representation of space and form In 1937, Picasso completed his iconic mural Guernica, a chilling depiction of the bombing of the Basque town of Guernica during the Spanish civil war, which resulted in the slaughter of many defenseless civilians Picasso painted Weeping Woman in October 1937 only a few months after he completed the mural It is one of a series of images of weeping women that have been linked to the figure of a grieving mother in Guernica who clasps her dead child to her chest. Weeping Woman is an iconic image of unspeakable grief and pain, representing universal suffering The fragmented features and the use of acid green and purple heighten the painting's emotional intensity The model for the Weeping Woman was Picasso's partner Dora Maar, a passionate, strong, and intelligent woman. The painting is also often seen as reflecting their complex and often stormy relationship.

                            14. Hormones regulating the female reproductive systemGonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is produced by a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. When it circulates in the blood, it causes the release of two important hormones (see below, and Figure 4.1) from the pituitary gland in another specialised part of the brain.Gonadotropin is pronounced ‘gonn add oh troh pinn’. Hypothalamus is pronounced ‘hy poh thah lah mooss’. Pituitary is pronounced ‘pitt yoo itt ary’.Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is produced by the pituitary gland during the first half of the menstrual cycle. It stimulates development of the maturing ovarian follicle and controls ovum production in the female, and sperm production in the male.Leutenizing hormone (LH) is also produced by the pituitary gland in the brain. It stimulates the ovaries to produce estrogen and progesterone. It triggers ovulation (the release of a mature ovum from the ovary), and it promotes the development of the corpus luteum.Estrogen is a female reproductive hormone, produced primarily by the ovaries in the non-pregnant woman. It promotes the maturation and release of an ovum in every menstrual cycle. It is also produced by the placenta during pregnancy.Progesterone is produced by the corpus luteum in the ovary; its function is to prepare the endometrium (lining of the uterus) for the reception and development of the fertilized ovum. It also suppresses the production of estrogen after ovulation has occurred.The ovarian cycle refers to the monthly series of events in the ovaries, associated with the maturation and release of an ovum, and the ‘just in case’ preparation for its fertilization and implantation in the uterus. The ovarian cycle consists of two consecutive phases, each of about 14 days’ duration. Events are measured from ‘day 1’, which is the first day of the last normal menstrual period (LNMP).The follicular phase: days 1 to 14The sequence shown in Figure above begins with the secretion of GnRH from the hypothalamus, which stimulates the pituitary gland to produce FSH and LH, which in turn act on the ovaries, telling the ovarian follicles to complete the maturation of an ovum. During this period, a few ovarian follicles containing immature ova develop and mature under the stimulation of FSH and LH. Usually by day 14, only one follicle has become fully mature, and the ovum it contains is ready to be released. All other follicles that had begun maturing during this phase of the ovarian cycle degenerate as soon as ovulation has occurred. Note that only one-time interval is fairly constant in all females — the time from ovulation to the beginning of menstruation, which is almost always 14 to15 days. However, the time of ovulation is variable and difficult to predict accurately.The luteal phase: days 15 to 28This phase is the period of corpus luteum activity, during which the uterus is prepared ‘just in case’ of pregnancy. After ovulation has occurred, the corpus luteum begins to secrete progesterone, as well as a small amount of estrogen. Progesterone maintains the uterus in a state ready to receive and nourish an embryo. The lining of the uterus (the endometrium) becomes thicker, more richly nourished by blood vessels, and more receptive to the fertilized ovum. Progesterone also inhibits any further release of FSH or LH from the pituitary gland.Thus, ovulation is quickly followed by a rise in the level of progesterone in the circulation, as the corpus luteum takes over the production of this hormone. As the progesterone level rises, it circulates around the body in the blood. When a high concentration of progesterone reaches the hypothalamus in the brain, the lect is to stop the hypothalamus from producing GnRH.QUESTIONS:1. What will happen when the hypothalamus stops producing GnRH? 2. What ffect will this have on the ovaries?​</h2><br />
                        <p>Answer:</p><p></p><p>1. If the hypothalamus stops producing Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) , the pituitary gland will not be stimulated to produce Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and Leutenizing hormone (LH) . </p><p></p><p>2. If Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and Leutenizing hormone (LH) are not produced, no hormone would act and tell the ovaries to mature. Also, ovulation would not occur. </p><p></p><p>I got this from the info u provided, hope this helps :&gt;. </p><br />
