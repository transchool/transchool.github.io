                            1. How is PCP II closely related to Vatican II</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>AT THE 1991 Second Plenary Council of the Philippines (PCP II), the Catholic Church opted wholeheartedly to be the first national church in the world to become a Church of the Poor. Ten years later, the Church had to admit that its effort had failed. Teodoro Bacani, bishop emeritus of Novaliches, wrote a few years later that the Church had thus missed its historic destiny.
</p><p>
</p><p>This commentary uses the writings of Bishop Bacani (especially an article titled “Church of the Poor: The Church in the Philippines’ Reception of Vatican II” that appeared on the East Asian Pastoral Institute website in 2005). Through these works, we looked more deeply into the Church’s 1991 decision and its subsequent failure to carry through and become the Church of the Poor. Did the delegates of PCP II have a limited understanding of the concept “Church of the Poor”? Has the Philippines suffered in any way because of the Church’s failure back then? Will we have another chance to become a Church of the Poor? Finally, is becoming a Church of the Poor an essential, sine qua non requisite for the formation of a just, democratic, compassionate and prosperous country for all peoples of all religions

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>This lacuna may reflect more on that famous school, on the Church, and on me as a negligent Catholic aunt, than on my nephew. His knowledge of PCP-II may even be more than that of most Filipino Catholics.
</p><p>
</p><p>Lack of interest may be a problem too. With the third sentence of this column I have probably lost 90 percent of those who began to read it. My last two readers may be hanging on only because they fear the loss of heaven and the pains of hell should they have naught to say when at the gates St. Peter asks, “What is PCP-II?” For these two, and for my nephew, I will soldier on.
</p><p>
</p><p>The Second Plenary Council of the Philippines (PCP-II) was the local Catholic Church’s articulation of her mission according to the Second Vatican Council (Vatican II). At the risk of insulting my two remaining readers, let me explain that Vatican II is why most Masses are no longer mumbled in Latin by a priest with his back to an uncomprehending congregation of veiled women and bored men.
</p><p>
</p><p>More than this, Vatican II reformed a Church cowering in defensive mode, trying vainly to enfold her faithful in arms crossed against the modern world. Vatican II pried open the Church’s arms to embrace that world, and defined for her a role of compassionate participation in its redemption.
</p><p>
</p><p>Vatican II ended in 1965. PCP-II was held in early 1991. The time lag is not further evidence that our country is a quarter century behind everyone else. The Philippine Catholic Church was no slouch all that time.
</p><p>
</p><p>The years 1966 to 1972 were swept up in post-Vatican II fervor, as Catholic lay activists, religious women and men, and clergy entered the battle for social and political rights alongside a highly mobilized civil society. They clamored with farmers for agrarian reform, fought demolitions arm in arm with informal settlers, and denounced electoral terrorism, with a vigor that heartened some bishops and dismayed others.
</p><p>
</p><p>From 1972 to 1986, these progressive Catholics, with the support of some bishops, continued under a brutal dictatorship to work with the poor and marginalized, at risk to their lives. They pushed the rest of the episcopate from acceptance of the dictatorship to a leading role in its collapse.
</p><p>
</p><p>From 1986 to 1991, the Church helped prop up a wobbly new democracy. Her bishops shepherded the post-authoritarian administration with moral support and criticism. Church personnel at lower levels fought for social justice under a new regime that allowed hope of success.
</p><p>
</p><p>Through all this, Catholic laity, clergy and religious had not sat down with their bishops to discuss what being a post-Vatican II Church meant. But after 25 years of living and dying for Vatican II’s implications, the Church was ready, in January 1991, to rewrite her mission according to those implications.
</p><p>
</p><p>That rewrite was a collective project. PCP-II had a participatory ethic remarkable for a Church with internal structures that resemble less a democracy than a benevolent dictatorship. The laity, religious and lower clergy were active in Council preparations, informing its agenda through surveys and consultations. Working papers drafted from this process were discussed for three months at all levels of the Church.
</p><p>
</p><p>At the Council, a third of the members were lay. Half were lower clergy and religious. Only bishops (less than 20 percent) could vote for approval of the Council’s procedures, documents and decrees. But the rest had recommendatory “consultative votes” which the bishops were expected to consider. Together these votes almost unanimously approved the Conciliar Document, which stressed the laity’s equality in the Church’s mission.
</p><p>
</p><p>Also significant was PCP-II’s commitment to social justice. PCP-II called upon the Philippine Catholic Church to be a “Church of the Poor,” a call at once traditional and radical. It was based on an ancient reading of Jesus’s “love of preference for the poor.” But it was transformed by the modern recognition that social hierarchies long accepted by Catholicism as God-ordained are the fruit of “sinful social structures,” which the Church is obligated to denounce and dismantle.
</p><p>
</p><p>The call was radical in another sense. It was not a call for the Church to work for the poor, or for elites to lift them out of poverty. It was a call to empower the poor and to work with them for social justice. The Conciliar Document recognized that elites could be an obstacle to the Church’s “mission of preference for the poor.” It lauded as an encouraging development the growth of organizations of the poor.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            4. The Church is called to serve most especially to the poor. It is called to be a “Church of the poor” and will always be for the poor. As a member of the Church, we are called to serve others in a special way that we can.
