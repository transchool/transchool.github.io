2. According to Aristotle, Acts of man are actions which are deliberately done.
3. Freedom and obligation are two distinct philosophical concepts.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>SCENARIO 1: A professor copies one article from a periodical for distribution to the class.</p><p></p><p>FAIR USE? Yes. Distribution of multiple copies for classroom use is fair use. However, the repeated use of a copyrighted work, from term-to-term, requires more scrutiny in a fair use evaluation. Repeated use, as well as a large class size, may weigh against fair use.</p><p></p><p>Posting Copyrighted Article to Web Page</p><p></p><p>SCENARIO 2: A professor has posted his class notes on a web page available to the public. He wants to scan an article from a copyrighted journal and add it to his web page.</p><p></p><p>FAIR USE? No, if access is open to the public, then this use is probably not a fair use. No exclusively educational purpose can be guaranteed by putting the article on the web, and such conduct would arguably violate the copyright holder's right of public distribution. If access to the web page is restricted, then it is more likely to be fair use.</p><p></p><p>Coursepacks</p><p></p><p>SCENARIO 3: A professor copies excerpts of documents, including copyrighted text books and journals, from various sources. The professor plans to distribute the materials to his class as a coursepack.</p><p></p><p>FAIR USE? Generally speaking, you need to obtain permission before reproducing copyrighted materials for an academic coursepack. It's the instructor's obligation to obtain clearance for materials used in class. Instructors typically delegate this task to one of the following: clearance services, university bookstores or copy shops, or Department administration.</p><br />
