Tribute to the People's Princess and Queen of Hearts
By Christopher Anderson
Radio and television commentators agree that no single event in history had ever been witnessed by so
many people at one time. An audience of more than 2.5 billion across the globe watched the solemn
progress of Diana’s body. Behind her carriage marched Prince Philip, Earl Spencer, Charles, Princes
William and Harry. Behind the royal princess walked five representatives from each of the 110 charities
the Princess had supported: some hobbling on crutches, others from her royal wheelchair brigade.
These were her people who never thought they would be marching in a royal procession.
According to Christopher Anderson, Princess Diana's biographer the procession itself evoked bittersweet
memories of her wedding sixteen years earlier, when the world watched the radiant young Princess and
her dashing new husband waving from their glittering carriage like the characters in a fairy tale. Now
letters scrawled on a pink ballet slipper tied to the gold-filigreed gates of Kensington Palace captured
the moment. You were Cinderella at the ball, and now you are Sleeping Beauty."
Two thousand mourners inside the Abbey ran the gamut from film, rock, and fashion stars to world
leaders, cancer survivors, battered women, and land mine victims. (Singer/Songwriter) Elton John's
heartfelt tribute to his friend, "Candle in the Wind 1997," reduced the mourners, including Prince Harry,
to tears and quickly became the biggest-selling single of all time. In his moving and pointed provocative
tribute to his sister, Earl Spencer renewed his attack on the press. "I don't think she ever understood
why her genuinely good intentions were sneered at by the media, why there appeared to be a
permanent quest on their behalf to bring her down. My own and only explanation is that genuine
goodness is threatening to those at the opposite end of the moral spectrum. It is a point to remember
that all of the ironies about Diana, perhaps the greatest was this-a girl given the name of the ancient
goddess of hunting was, in the end, the most hunted person of the modern age. Also, there is no need
to canonize her because to do so would be to miss out on the very core of her being... For all the status,
the glamor, the applause, Diana remained throughout a very insecure person at heart, almost childlike
in her desire to do good for others so she could release herself from a deep feeling of unworthiness.
Then Diana's brother flung down the gauntlet before the House of Windsor itself. With Queen Victoria
seated a few yards away, he praised Diana as the very essence of compassion, duty, style, and beauty.
Someone with a natural nobility who was classless and who needed no royal title to continue to
generate her particular brand of magic. Prince Charles went ashen when the Earl pledged to Diana You
sent condition in the name of the Spencers that "we, your blood family, will do all we can to continue
the imaginative way in which you were steering your two exceptional young sons so that their souls are
no simply immersed by duty and tradition but can sing openly as you planned."
The Queen Mother looked startled, Hillary Clinton gasped audibly but the Queen, staring ahead at the
coffin, remained as inscrutable as ever. Prince Charles, whose own deeply felt grief over Diana's death
surprised even him, beat his fist against his knee.
Finally Earl Spencer's voice cracked with emotion as he thanked God "For the small mercies he has
shown us at this dreadful time. For taking Diana at her most beautiful and radiant moment and when
she had joy in her private life. Above all, we give thanks for the life of. . . the unique, the complex, the
extraordinary, and irreplaceable Diana-whose beauty, both internal and external, will never be
extinguished from our minds.

Dodong felt saddened that he knew that what happened to him, will happen to his son as well. He knew that what happened to him will also happen to his son and to the later generations.
Dodong is a teen-ager who decides to marry at a very young age and later repent of his decision. Eventually, Dodong did tell his parents about his problem which is the conflict of the story which is his desire to marry at such a young age of 17.
Dodong was uncertain to tell his father about him and Teang which he considers truly important. The paragraph describes Dodong doing farm work while in thought of something very heavy as to how to announce a certain news to his parents. Here it also describes the characteristics of his father.</a>

Tribute to the People's Princess and Queen of Hearts
By Christopher Anderson
Radio and television commentators agree that no single event in history had ever been witnessed by so
many people at one time. An audience of more than 2.5 billion across the globe watched the solemn
progress of Diana’s body. Behind her carriage marched Prince Philip, Earl Spencer, Charles, Princes
William and Harry. Behind the royal princess walked five representatives from each of the 110 charities
the Princess had supported: some hobbling on crutches, others from her royal wheelchair brigade.
These were her people who never thought they would be marching in a royal procession.
According to Christopher Anderson, Princess Diana's biographer the procession itself evoked bittersweet
memories of her wedding sixteen years earlier, when the world watched the radiant young Princess and
her dashing new husband waving from their glittering carriage like the characters in a fairy tale. Now
letters scrawled on a pink ballet slipper tied to the gold-filigreed gates of Kensington Palace captured
the moment. You were Cinderella at the ball, and now you are Sleeping Beauty."
Two thousand mourners inside the Abbey ran the gamut from film, rock, and fashion stars to world
leaders, cancer survivors, battered women, and land mine victims. (Singer/Songwriter) Elton John's
heartfelt tribute to his friend, "Candle in the Wind 1997," reduced the mourners, including Prince Harry,
to tears and quickly became the biggest-selling single of all time. In his moving and pointed provocative
tribute to his sister, Earl Spencer renewed his attack on the press. "I don't think she ever understood
why her genuinely good intentions were sneered at by the media, why there appeared to be a
permanent quest on their behalf to bring her down. My own and only explanation is that genuine
goodness is threatening to those at the opposite end of the moral spectrum. It is a point to remember
that all of the ironies about Diana, perhaps the greatest was this-a girl given the name of the ancient
goddess of hunting was, in the end, the most hunted person of the modern age. Also, there is no need
to canonize her because to do so would be to miss out on the very core of her being... For all the status,
the glamor, the applause, Diana remained throughout a very insecure person at heart, almost childlike
in her desire to do good for others so she could release herself from a deep feeling of unworthiness.
Then Diana's brother flung down the gauntlet before the House of Windsor itself. With Queen Victoria
seated a few yards away, he praised Diana as the very essence of compassion, duty, style, and beauty.
Someone with a natural nobility who was classless and who needed no royal title to continue to
generate her particular brand of magic. Prince Charles went ashen when the Earl pledged to Diana You
sent condition in the name of the Spencers that "we, your blood family, will do all we can to continue
the imaginative way in which you were steering your two exceptional young sons so that their souls are
no simply immersed by duty and tradition but can sing openly as you planned."
The Queen Mother looked startled, Hillary Clinton gasped audibly but the Queen, staring ahead at the
coffin, remained as inscrutable as ever. Prince Charles, whose own deeply felt grief over Diana's death
surprised even him, beat his fist against his knee.
Finally Earl Spencer's voice cracked with emotion as he thanked God "For the small mercies he has
shown us at this dreadful time. For taking Diana at her most beautiful and radiant moment and when
she had joy in her private life. Above all, we give thanks for the life of. . . the unique, the complex, the
extraordinary, and irreplaceable Diana-whose beauty, both internal and external, will never be
extinguished from our minds.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>       Also known as The Story of the Aged Mother, this Japanese folktale tells the story of an unkind ruler who issues cruel orders, including one demand that all old folks are to be abandoned and left to die. Basho tells a poignant story about a mother and her son and their love for one another. The governor did not penalize him for rescuing his mother, but he did withdraw his proclamation as he recognized the value of the elderly in a country's development. The narrative ends with the moral that the knowledge of the elderly is just as vital as the strength of the youth.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>FIRST</strong>, there was a cruel ruler of the land who despised anything related to deteriorating health and strength, particularly in the elderly. He issued a proclamation to have the elderly sent to Obatsuyama, or the mountain where "the aged are abandoned," and left to die.</p><p><strong>NEXT</strong>: A man and his elderly widowed mother resided in that country at the base of the mountain. The man was moved to send his cherished mother to the mountain after hearing the announcement.</p><p>His mother instructed him to follow the twigs she had laid on the ground while ascending the mountain right before he reached the summit and before climbing down.</p><p>He returned home with his mother and hid her beneath the floor where he cared for her since he could not bear to part with her.</p><p><strong>THEN</strong>: One day, the monarch wanted to show off his strength and ordered everyone, even his wisemen, to create an "ash rope." The son followed his mother's advice and used a twisted straw to create the rope, which he then burned on a row of flat stones on a windless night.</p><p>Knowing that he had help, he told the monarch that his mother's age and wisdom had enabled him to accomplish such an impossible task.</p><p><strong>Last</strong> but not least, the emperor initially imprisoned the guy but then changed his mind and quoted the proverb "With the crown of snow, there cometh wisdom! ”. As a result, the proclamation was revoked and the custom was discontinued.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Here is the summary of the aged mother:</p><p></p><p>There lived a cruel ruler of the land who despises anything of failing health and strength, especially on the elderly. He made a proclamation to have the elderly sent to the mountain called Obatsuyama or the mountain where “the aged are abandoned” and leaves them to die.In that land lived a man and his old widowed mother who are at the foot of the mountain. Upon hearing the proclamation, the man was compelled to sent the mother he loves to the mountain.</p><p></p><p>By the time he reached the summit, just before he climbed down the mountain, he was advised by his mother to follow the twigs she left laying on the ground while he was going up the mountain.He could not bear leaving her so he went home with his mother and hid her beneath the floor where he tended her.</p><p></p><p>One day, the ruler wanted to boast his power and ordered anyone, even his wisemen, to make a “rope of ashes”, which the son did with the help of his mother’s wisdom by making a rope of twisted straw and burn the rope stretched on a row of flat stones on one windless night.Knowing that he did not do it alone, he told the ruler that it was with the wisdom of his elderly mother that he was able to do such impossible task.</p><p></p><p>At first the ruler imprisoned the man but eventually, he came to his senses and cited the saying: “with the crown of snow, there cometh wisdom!”. Hence, the proclamation was abolished and he custom was long gone.</p><br />
