The roles of English within and between many of the countries which make up Asia are increasing,
and English is constantly being used and negotiated as a mutual means of communication by Asian
multilinguals for whom English is an additional language. It is timely, therefore, to consider ways in which
these Englishes have been developing, along with the roles English is currently playing. Areas worthy of

The roles of English within and between the many of the countries which make up Southeast Asia are increasing, and English is constantly being used and negotiated as a mutual means of communication by Asian multilinguals for whom English is an additional language. It is timely, therefore, to consider ways in which these Englishes have been developing, along with the roles English is currently playing. Areas worthy of investigation include the influence of language contact and the motivations for the presence of non‐standard forms in these new varieties of English. Given the recent research reviewed in this paper, the criteria by which the use of non‐standard forms are classified as characteristic of the particular variety need to be revised. The paper will conclude by considering whether the role of English as a lingua franca in the region has reached its zenith and whether regional language education policy is likely allow the languages of Asia to thrive.

Which group do you think has more Spanish influence? Why?According to Merriam-Webster dictionary, a Liturgy is a fixed set of ceremonies that are used duringpublic worship in a religion. Every religion or sect has its own rites for praising God. These may be in a formof bible sharing, testimonies, singing, dancing, and chanting. Our discussion will dwell more on the RomanCatholic religion's liturgy, since majority of our country's population are baptized in this religion.For the Catholics, liturgy is about God's saving work present in the life, death and resurrection ofJesus, and the highlight of these three is the celebration of the Holy Mass wherein the priest is the maincelebrant. The Holy Mass is the highest form of liturgy with which the body and blood of Christ is the centerof the whole celebration. Liturgy is a ritual prayer of a community and each member takes part in thecelebration. And this is where Liturgical Music comes in.MThe first type of liturgical music that Filipinos learned from the Spaniards was in Latin. During theLiturgy, they sang Gregorian Chants, hymns and all forms of sacred music in Latin. Gradually, aside fromsinging, Spaniards taught the natives to play musical instruments like guitar, violin, flute and the organ.Later on, the music in different churches blossomed in 1857, a boys' choir was formed in Sto. DomingoDominican convent and later a pipe organ was installed. In 1601, the first orchestra was formed in theAugustinian convent in Guadalupe, in 1643, the Manila Orchestra was organized by a priest, between 1816 -1824, the famous Bamboo Organ was built. In 1870, Marcelo Adonay, the first native Filipino to compose amass, led an orchestra which was formed at San Agustine Church in Intramuros.Because the natives wanted a liturgy that they can understand aside from the Latin liturgicalcelebrations in churches, extra liturgical services outside the churches evolved. The Panuluyan,Pabasa,Salubong and other forms of devotions were sang in Spanish and in their native tongue.In 1903, Pope Pius X encouraged the participation of the congregation in the celebration of theLiturgy. This led to the use of local language in Churches, like what we have today. The community is alsoencouraged to have an active participation in every liturgical celebration, either by singing, responses orgestures. There are specific persons who play an important role in the liturgy. They are called musicministers. They have the responsibility of ensuring that the music is appropriate to the liturgy. But what arethe criteria for choosing music? According to the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy (CSL, 1963), one of thekey documents of Vatican II, the basic criteria for sacred music are:​</a>

The roles of English within and between many of the countries which make up Asia are increasing,
and English is constantly being used and negotiated as a mutual means of communication by Asian
multilinguals for whom English is an additional language. It is timely, therefore, to consider ways in which
these Englishes have been developing, along with the roles English is currently playing. Areas worthy of
investigation include the influence of language contact and the motivations for the presence of non-standard
forms in these new varieties of English. Given the research reviewed in this paper, the criteria by which the
use of non-standard forms is classified as characteristic of the particular variety need to be revised.

The roles of English within and between the many of the countries which make up Southeast Asia are increasing, and English is constantly being used and negotiated as a mutual means of communication by Asian multilinguals for whom English is an additional language. It is timely, therefore, to consider ways in which these Englishes have been developing, along with the roles English is currently playing. Areas worthy of investigation include the influence of language contact and the motivations for the presence of non‐standard forms in these new varieties of English. Given the recent research reviewed in this paper, the criteria by which the use of non‐standard forms are classified as characteristic of the particular variety need to be revised. The paper will conclude by considering whether the role of English as a lingua franca in the region has reached its zenith and whether regional language education policy is likely allow the languages of Asia to thrive.

Why?According to Merriam-Webster dictionary, a Liturgy is a fixed set of ceremonies that are used duringpublic worship in a religion. Every religion or sect has its own rites for praising God. These may be in a formof bible sharing, testimonies, singing, dancing, and chanting. Our discussion will dwell more on the RomanCatholic religion's liturgy, since majority of our country's population are baptized in this religion.For the Catholics, liturgy is about God's saving work present in the life, death and resurrection ofJesus, and the highlight of these three is the celebration of the Holy Mass wherein the priest is the maincelebrant. The Holy Mass is the highest form of liturgy with which the body and blood of Christ is the centerof the whole celebration. Liturgy is a ritual prayer of a community and each member takes part in thecelebration. And this is where Liturgical Music comes in.MThe first type of liturgical music that Filipinos learned from the Spaniards was in Latin. During theLiturgy, they sang Gregorian Chants, hymns and all forms of sacred music in Latin. Gradually, aside fromsinging, Spaniards taught the natives to play musical instruments like guitar, violin, flute and the organ.Later on, the music in different churches blossomed in 1857, a boys' choir was formed in Sto. DomingoDominican convent and later a pipe organ was installed. In 1601, the first orchestra was formed in theAugustinian convent in Guadalupe, in 1643, the Manila Orchestra was organized by a priest, between 1816 -1824, the famous Bamboo Organ was built. In 1870, Marcelo Adonay, the first native Filipino to compose amass, led an orchestra which was formed at San Agustine Church in Intramuros.Because the natives wanted a liturgy that they can understand aside from the Latin liturgicalcelebrations in churches, extra liturgical services outside the churches evolved. The Panuluyan,Pabasa,Salubong and other forms of devotions were sang in Spanish and in their native tongue.In 1903, Pope Pius X encouraged the participation of the congregation in the celebration of theLiturgy. This led to the use of local language in Churches, like what we have today. The community is alsoencouraged to have an active participation in every liturgical celebration, either by singing, responses orgestures. There are specific persons who play an important role in the liturgy. They are called musicministers. They have the responsibility of ensuring that the music is appropriate to the liturgy. But what arethe criteria for choosing music? According to the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy (CSL, 1963), one of thekey documents of Vatican II, the basic criteria for sacred music are:​</h2><br />
