A composer, music teacher, conductor, and clarinetist, he created substantial works for the orchestra. He served as conductor for opera, ballet, dance recitals, and movie music. His early interest in music came from the influence of his uncle who was then playing with the Bacoor Band. His first music lessons in music theory and clarinet were with Fr. Amando Buencamino who taught him solfeggio and some musical instruments. When he was eight years old, he was accepted as a member of the Bacoor Band as a clarinetist. After he graduated from high school in 1930, he co-founded the Anak Zapote Band. He became full professor of the UP Conservatory of Music from 1936-1937.

Buenaventura further developed his musical abilities at the Conservatory of Music, University of the Philippines (UP) at the age of 19. He received a Teacher’s Diploma in Science and Composition at UP. Nicanor Abelardo and Francisco Santiago were among his famous mentors. He was also awarded a study grant by the UNESCO in 1949. Buenaventura was actively involved with the various military bands which ultimately earned him his military rank of Colonel. Later, he restored the Philippine Constabulary Band in 1945, which was reputedly likened to a symphony orchestra. It was considered as “one of the best military bands in the world.” It would later be renamed the Philippine Army Band. He also founded the San Pablo Music Academy in Laguna. Later, he became the music director of the Conservatory of Music, University of Santo Tomas (UST) in 1961.
