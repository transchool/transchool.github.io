The Climb
There's always gonna be another
mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what's waiting on the other
side
It's the c
There's always gonna be another
mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what's waiting on the other
side
It's the climb
Jesus, Take the Wheel
Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
And save me from this road I'm
on
Jesus, take the wheel</a>

Oh, oh-oh To get to the other side (The other si-i-i-ide) Why did the chicken cross the road? Oh, oh-oh Why did the chicken cross the road? (To get to the other side!) Why did the chicken cross the road? Oh, oh-oh To get to the other side (The other si-i-i-ide) Jump in the Cadillac, girl, let's put some miles on it Anything you want (Just to put a smile on it) You deserve it, baby, you deserve it all And I'm gonna give it to you Feel like I'm the chicken crossing through the road alone And I don't know everything I want and need to know But you deserve all my attention every moment I can't prevent my need to be with you in your home Why did the chicken cross the road? Oh, oh-oh Why did the chicken cross the road? Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the other side (The other si-i-i-ide) Jump in the Cadillac, girl, let's put some miles on it Anything you want (Just to put a smile on it) You deserve it, baby, you deserve it all And I'm gonna give it to you, to you ​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>At the simplest level, the song is about the ebony (black) and ivory (white) keys on a piano, but also deals with integration and racial harmony on a deeper level. The title was inspired by McCartney hearing Spike Milligan say "black notes, white notes, and you need to play the two to make harmony, folks!"</p><br />

Can you determine the underlying meaning of the lyrics of the song?</h2><br />
                        I think the composer of the song is comparing his relationship to someone with that of the keys of the piano, that even with the difference of color of black and white there is still peace, maybe the relationship that he had isn't peaceful, or just trying to imply the relationship of most people where peace does not exist.<br /><br />

The Climb
There's always gonna be another
mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what's waiting on the other
side
It's the c
There's always gonna be another
mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what's waiting on the other
side
It's the climb
Jesus, Take the Wheel
Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
And save me from this road I'm
on
Jesus, take the wheel</h2><br />

Oh, oh-oh Why did the chicken cross the road? (To get to the other side!) Why did the chicken cross the road? Oh, oh-oh To get to the other side (The other si-i-i-ide) Why did the chicken cross the road? Oh, oh-oh Why did the chicken cross the road? (To get to the other side!) Why did the chicken cross the road? Oh, oh-oh To get to the other side (The other si-i-i-ide) Jump in the Cadillac, girl, let's put some miles on it Anything you want (Just to put a smile on it) You deserve it, baby, you deserve it all And I'm gonna give it to you Feel like I'm the chicken crossing through the road alone And I don't know everything I want and need to know But you deserve all my attention every moment I can't prevent my need to be with you in your home Why did the chicken cross the road? Oh, oh-oh Why did the chicken cross the road? Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the other side (The other si-i-i-ide) Jump in the Cadillac, girl, let's put some miles on it Anything you want (Just to put a smile on it) You deserve it, baby, you deserve it all And I'm gonna give it to you, to you ​</h2><br />
