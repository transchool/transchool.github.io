                                            (guess the lyrics po kong alam po nyo yong answer) good luck
Broken all the pieces I've been shaping lately
Focused on the things that didn't make no sense
Guess that growing up was never meant to be easy
Yeah, I got used to doing everything sideways
Didn't really care about how everyone felt
Hiding my emotions down in different ashtrays
Oh, but what is lost ain't gone
No, you can't just let go
'Cause it's a part of you that will make you strong
Embrace your flaws
I'm not gonna fight back what I've become
Yeah, I've got bruises where I came from
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
I've been going way too hard on myself
Guess that it's the reason that I'm feeling like hell
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
I went down a road that only got me nowhere
I've seen every corner, every inch of this place
Being all alone it really got me thinking
Maybe overthinking
That what is lost ain't gone
No, you can't just let go
'Cause it's a part of you that will make you strong
Embrace your flaws
I'm not gonna fight back what I've become
Yeah, I've got bruises where I came from
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
I've been going way too hard on myself
Guess that it's the reason that I'm feeling like hell
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
Hide these beautiful scars
Hide these beautiful scars
I'm not gonna fight back what I've become
Yeah, I've got bruises where I came from
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
I've been going way too hard on myself
Guess that it's the reason that I'm feeling like hell
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
Hide these
I ain't gonna hide these
Hide these
Hide these beautiful scars
No

                                            THE SONG IS DEMONS
When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all and the blood's run stale
I want to hide the truth, I want to shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
At the curtain's call is the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made
Don't want to let you down, but I am hell bound
Though this is all for you, don't want to hide the truth
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
They say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright, I want to save that light
I can't escape this now, unless you show me how
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide</a>

                            3. what have you noticed in lyrics of the song all by myself by celine dion​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>At its core, “All by Myself” focuses on a man aging. Nothing proves this more than the opening lyrics:</p><p></p><p>When I was young</p><p></p><p>I never needed anyone</p><p></p><p>And making love was just for fun</p><p></p><p>Those days are gone</p><p></p><p>Livin’ alone</p><p></p><p>I think of all the friends I’ve known</p><p></p><p>But when I dial the telephone</p><p></p><p>Nobody’s home</p><p></p><p>In many of the cinematic versions of this song, the film cuts off the opening lyrics in favor of the first overture of “All by Myself,” thus making a song about aging into a song disappointment and heartbreak (depending on the context).</p><br />

                            5. Why do people always hide their emotions or feeling even though they're suffering inside?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Nearly everyone hides their feelings from time to time.</p><p></p><p>Say your partner reveals something at a family gathering you asked them to keep private. You’re upset and embarrassed, but you pretend everything’s fine until you get home, where you can talk alone. You don’t want to argue in front of your extended family and make the conflict worse.</p><p></p><p>Occasional emotional suppression generally won’t cause problems as long as you eventually work through them in healthy, productive ways.</p><p></p><p>It can become an issue, however, if it becomes a pattern and affects your ability to communicate authentically.</p><p>People often hide emotions to protect their relationships. When someone you care about does something upsetting, you might choose to hide your annoyance. Yes, their actions bothered you. But if they react negatively when you tell them how you feel, you could end up triggering an even more painful conflict.</p><br />

                        <strong>8 WAYS TO BECOME PROFESSIONAL IN THE WORKPLACE</strong><p>Acting like a professional really means doing what it takes to make others think of you as reliable, respectful, and competent. However it depends on where you work and the type of job you have, it may take various forms. But here are the common traits of being a Professional.</p><p><strong>1. Develop Competency</strong>: A workplace competency is a description of desired skill, attribute or behavior for a job which is used to measure an individual’s effectiveness. Usually workplace competency is judged from 2 aspects: Behavioral and Technical. Behavioral competencies are judged based on work confidentially, inspire others and submit monthly reports on time, while technical competencies are judged based on written communication skills, knowledge of procedures and ability to resolve conflict.</p><p><strong>2. Reliability:</strong> Reliability is essential to employee performance. A reliable employee is the one who always complete his/her work in time. </p><p><strong>3. Honesty:</strong> Being honest means “refrain from lying”. You tell the truth and are upfront about where things stand. You should always address mistakes as soon as possible. </p><p><strong>4. Be systematic:</strong> A professional is the one who follows time and keeps his/her employers happy. Always create a schedule of your task and try to manage your work with proper breaks and time slots.</p><p><strong>5. Keep good relation:</strong> Treat all people as important as if they mattered a lot. Assure them you are approachable and they can discuss their problem during tough times, but maintain the required distance. A good professional always share his/her knowledge, opinion or simply an extra pair of hands. </p><p><strong>6. Being Positive and friendly:</strong> Have you ever noticed that the employee with friendly and positive attitude in the work place have more friends? Employees with positive attitude are more productive and result oriented as they make it easier for everyone to get along in the workplace. </p><p><strong>7. Communicate and listen carefully:</strong> Communicate in a professional manner, listen attentively to others ideas, problems, maintain a eye contact and practice a solid handshake. </p><p><strong>8. Dress code and appearance: </strong>Choose modest and conservative clothing that reflect the more formal attire accepted at the workplace. However there are certain workplace where dress code was often used, this is done in the office premises to communicate a corporate image and ensure that customer can easily identify them.</p><br />

                            24. (guess the lyrics po kong alam po nyo yong answer) good luck
Broken all the pieces I've been shaping lately
Focused on the things that didn't make no sense
Guess that growing up was never meant to be easy
Yeah, I got used to doing everything sideways
Didn't really care about how everyone felt
Hiding my emotions down in different ashtrays
Oh, but what is lost ain't gone
No, you can't just let go
'Cause it's a part of you that will make you strong
Embrace your flaws
I'm not gonna fight back what I've become
Yeah, I've got bruises where I came from
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
I've been going way too hard on myself
Guess that it's the reason that I'm feeling like hell
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
I went down a road that only got me nowhere
I've seen every corner, every inch of this place
Being all alone it really got me thinking
Maybe overthinking
That what is lost ain't gone
No, you can't just let go
'Cause it's a part of you that will make you strong
Embrace your flaws
I'm not gonna fight back what I've become
Yeah, I've got bruises where I came from
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
I've been going way too hard on myself
Guess that it's the reason that I'm feeling like hell
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
Hide these beautiful scars
Hide these beautiful scars
I'm not gonna fight back what I've become
Yeah, I've got bruises where I came from
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
I've been going way too hard on myself
Guess that it's the reason that I'm feeling like hell
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
Hide these
I ain't gonna hide these
Hide these
Hide these beautiful scars
No

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>When danger strikes, turtles use their flexible necks to retract their heads safely inside their shield-like shells. Evolutionary researchers have long assumed that turtles developed this trick as protection against predators, but new research suggests that its original purpose was likely not defense, but food.</p><br />

                            28. THE SONG IS DEMONS
When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all and the blood's run stale
I want to hide the truth, I want to shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
At the curtain's call is the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made
Don't want to let you down, but I am hell bound
Though this is all for you, don't want to hide the truth
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
They say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright, I want to save that light
I can't escape this now, unless you show me how
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide</h2><br />
