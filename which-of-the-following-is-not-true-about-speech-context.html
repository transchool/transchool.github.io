                        <p>1. C</p><p>2. D</p><p>3. A</p><p>4. B</p>What is communication?<p><strong>Communication</strong> is typically defined as the exchange of information. The phrase can either be used to indicate the transmission of a single message or a specific area of research into such transmissions. There is considerable disagreement on its exact definition.</p><p><strong>Communication</strong>, which might take the form of talking, writing, listening, or reading, includes giving, receiving, and exchanging information. Effective communicators listen carefully to others' viewpo1nts, speak or write clearly, and respect others' perspectives. The act of communicating involves giving and receiving signals via both verbal and nonverbal ways. The aim of communication is to foster understanding between two or more parties by the two-way exchange of information in the form of ideas, thoughts, and opinions.</p><p></p><p><strong>Seven Elements of An Effective Communication</strong></p><p><strong>SENDER</strong> - The individual who is attempting to send a message is known as the sender.</p><p><strong>RECEIVER</strong> - The message must be understood by the recipient, who must then convert the words into thoughts, analyze the thoughts, and choose how to respond to the sender.</p><p><strong>MESSAGE</strong> - Congruency, or agreement, between the words, meaning, and emotion constitutes a successful message. Congruency requires careful attention to both vocal inflection and body expression.</p><p><strong>CHANNEL</strong> - The channel is the medium the sender uses to communicate with the recipient. This could be done verbally, in writing, via text’ message, over the phone, via email, or by a third party.</p><p><strong>NOISE</strong> - Interference that occurs during communication is referred to as noise. Noise has the potential to divert both the emitter and the receiver. Both internal (thoughts, emotions, etc.) and exterior sources can produce noise (radios, other conversations, etc.).</p><p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong> - Feedback is the process of figuring out whether the message has been understood correctly. The sender or the receiver may start this.</p><p><strong>CONTEXT</strong> - Another approach to consider the situation is through context.</p><p></p><p>To learn more about communication, just click the link below:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/2930495</p><p>#SPJ2</p><p></p><p></p><br />
