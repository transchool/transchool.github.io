 As part of a democratic country, I believe that we possess utmost right of freedom of self expression. Our voice and advocacy serve an important role to secure and protect the future of our country. There are wide varieties of social media platforms that have become a passageway to manifest our own will. Nowadays, there are also a lot of things happening that test the stability of the aforementioned right. As a student, we have so much access of information around us. We have the power to contribute for the betterment of our society.

</p><p>We have different kinds of nouns. POSSESSIVE nouns show who or what owns something. COLLECTIVE nouns are words for groups of people, animals or things. COUNT nouns refer to things that can be easily counted while MASS nouns are those that cannot be counted.​
</p><p>
</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Count nouns are words that indicate discrete, countable objects (e.g., forks, viewpoints), whereas mass nouns are words that indicate some relatively undifferentiated substance (e.g., water, energy).

Write your answers ona separate blank sheet of paper.1. What are possessive pronouns?2. What are the examples of possessive pronouns?3. When do we use the possessive pronouns her and hers?4. When do we use the possessive pronoun his and his?5. When do we use the possessive pronouns their and theirs?6. When do we use the possessive pronouns your and yours?7. When do we use the possessive pronouns my and mine?8. When do we use the possessive pronouns our and ours?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Possessive pronouns describe what things belong to which people, like "her shoe" or "the book is mine." Possessive pronouns can be adjectives, like "his bicycle," or they can stand in for nouns, like "the seats are theirs." Neither of these forms should have apostrophes to show possession -- so it's ours (not our's)</p><p></p><p>2. Possessive pronouns include my, mine, our, ours, its, his, her, hers, their, theirs, your and yours. These are all words that demonstrate ownership.</p><p></p><p>3. Both 'her' and 'hers' are possessives used to indicate as 'belonging to some 'SHE'. HER is possessive adjective and HERS possessive pronoun of SHE. Usually for a name or a noun we add an apostrophe and 's' to get the possessive meaning.</p><p></p><p>4. He's is the short form of 'he is' or 'he has'. For example: " Don't be scared - he's very friendly." His is a possessive pronoun, it is used to show something belonging to or connected with a man, boy or male animal that has just been mentioned. For example: "Mark just phoned to say he'd left his coat behind.</p><p></p><p>5. Theirs is used as a possessive pronoun, being a possessive form of they. It can refer to a singular or plural noun, and it can be the subject, object, or complement of a verb or the object of a preposition: Our cat is dark grey, but theirs is black. Our children are definitely better behaved than theirs. Their is the possessive pronoun, as in "their car is red"; there is used as an adjective, "he is always there for me," a noun, "get away from there," and, chiefly, an adverb, "stop right there"; they're is a contraction of "they are," as in "they're getting married."</p><p></p><p>6. Your means a form of the possessive case of you when used as a pronoun. Yours means that which belongs to you (singular); the possessive second-person singular pronoun used without a following noun when used as a pronoun. A good way to remember the difference is Your has an object; yours is the object.</p><p></p><p>7. The difference between My and Mine is that My is a possessive adjective and pronoun while Mine can only be used as a possessive pronoun. “My” comes before a noun, whereas “Mine” comes after the noun.</p><p></p><p>8. Ours vs Our's Ours is the first person plural possessive pronoun – it replaces "our" + noun. He can't find his keys, but ours are on the table. Though you may see our's written even by native speakers, it is incorrect. Ours should never have an apostrophe</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it helps!^^</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:While place attachment has received some recent attention in social science literature, such attention reveals the narrow partitions that have been employed in seeking to understand our bonds to the material environment. For bonds to place share much of the same phenomenology as bonds to our children, a favorite sweater, our cars, a pet, the family photograph album, and our own bodies. What such attachments have in common is their importance, for better or worse, in defining the self in a contemporary consumer culture. This linkage was clearly articulated by William James (1890):
</strong></p><p><strong>Our fame, our children, the works of our hands, may be as dear to us as our bodies are, and arouse the same feelings and the same acts of reprisal if attacked. ... a man’s Self is the sum total of all that he CAN call his, not only his body and his psychic powers, but his clothes, and his house, his wife and children, his ancestors and friends, his reputation and works, his lands, and yacht and bank-account. All these things give him the same emotions. If they wax and prosper, he feels triumphant; if they dwindle and die away, he feels cast down.

                            24. Free Expression
 As part of a democratic country, I believe that we possess utmost right of freedom of self expression. Our voice and advocacy serve an important role to secure and protect the future of our country. There are wide varieties of social media platforms that have become a passageway to manifest our own will. Nowadays, there are also a lot of things happening that test the stability of the aforementioned right. As a student, we have so much access of information around us. We have the power to contribute for the betterment of our society. 
What can you say about this? Do you think it has something to do with how most of us create and envision the society that we wanted to live in? Why? State your claims below.</h2><br />
                        I think being influenced by those around you has a bigger impact in one's life. If you grew up in a household withholding specific beliefs and views about something—especially in a political aspect—you might even adapt their way of thinking and rationalize it in a more sensible way for you to understand. <br />
