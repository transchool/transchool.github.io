Learning Task 1. Prepare the materials listed below. If not available, you may use other materials at home to perform the activity You may ask the help of your parents/guardians or any adult members of the family if needed. Title: Erosion By Water Materials: 2 small pans 6 cups of garden soil 2 bottles of 500 ml water Procedures: 1. Get 2 small pans and fill them with garden soil. Label one pan as A and the other as B. 2. Pour water gradually in the soil on the first pan. What happened to the soil? Describe the movement of the soil. 3. Repeat procedure number 2 on the second pan. This time pour the water rapidly into the soil. What happened? Compare the difference in terms of the movement of the soil from the first one. 4. Record the time and measure your observations, Questions: 1. Based on your observation, in which setup did the soil move faster? Why? 2. Based on your observation, in which setup did the soil move farther? Why? 3. Based on your observation, which setup moved more soll? Why? 4. As you observed, what happened to the color of the water? 5. Based on the data collected in the experiment, what can you conclude about soil erosion? Learning Task 2.

4. An interview should only focus on the demographic characteristics of the participants.
5. Opinion questions require the participants to explain what they have done or are
doing.
6. Knowledge questions require the participants to explain what they feel about an issue.
7. An interview is more time-consuming than an observation.
8. An Observation can be done in a controlled or natural setting.
9. Observation enables a researcher to create a description of events and people’s behavior in a selected community.
10. There should be multiple observers conducting an observation to increase the reliability and validity of the data.
11. participant’s observation involves becoming part of the community that is being studied.
12. The interaction among the members of the target community can be one of the variables looked into in an observation.

14. It is important to ask help from experts in creating an interview or observation guide.
15. An informed consent form is a document required before conducting an interview or observation
16. Initial coding involves creating categories out of the gathered data.
17. Intermediate coding involves labelling concepts and terms using codes.
18. Advanced coding involves integrating categories created out of data into existing
theories.

The Ecological concept relies on morphological data and emphasizes groups of physical traits that are unique to each species._____________19. The Morphological species concept is a set of organisms that is adapted to a particular set of resources (niche) in the environment, which explains differences in form and behaviour between species as adaptations to resource availability_____________20. Species is are often defined as a group of individuals with similar characteristics, where they can interbreed to produce fertile offsprings. “To differentiate between different types of living organisms, species is used as the principal natural unit in biology​</a>

                                            What is quantitative research?By definition, quantitative research is an objective, systematic empiricalinvestigation of observable phenomena through the use of computational techniques. Ithighlights numerical analysis of data hoping that the numbers yield unbiased results thatcan be generalized to some larger population and explain a particular observation(Faltado III et al., 2016)Moreover, Baraceros (2016) expounded that expressions like numerical forms,objective thinking, statistical methods, and measurement signal the existence ofquantitative research. It involves measurements and amounts and seeks to find answersto questions how many, how much, how long, to what extent and the like.Finding out how many students eat at the school canteen every lunch time, or howmuch allowance do senior high school students have every day is quantitative.Quantitative vs. QualitativeSo, how is quantitative research different from qualitative research? One word thatreflects the true nature of quantitative research is numerical. On the other hand,qualitative is subjective, interpretive, exploratory and requires heavy narratives.To be more specific, quantitative research deals with numbers, collects data whichcan be measured like length, height, area, volume, weight, speed, time, temperature,humidity, sound levels, costs, members, ages, scores, etc. while qualitative research dealswith description, and collects data which can be observed but not measured like colors,textures, smells, tastes, appearance, beauty, etc.Thus, you conduct a qualitative research when you want to know the commonthemes in Shakespeare's works but you conduct a quantitative research when you want toknow how many sonnets and plays he wrote.You employ quantitative research in finding out the IQ levels of the Grade 7students; however, you do qualitative research in describing the hardships andchallenges faced by the working students.Think about a headline you read from a newspaper, listened from a radio orwatched from the television.

2. An Example of an unstructured interview is a self-administered questionnaire.
3. The interview questions should be directly related to the research questions.
4. An interview should only focus on the demographic characteristics of the participants.
5. Opinion questions require the participants to explain what they have done or are
doing.
6. Knowledge questions require the participants to explain what they feel about an issue.
7. An interview is more time-consuming than an observation.
8. An Observation can be done in a controlled or natural setting.
9. Observation enables a researcher to create a description of events and people’s behavior in a selected community.
10. There should be multiple observers conducting an observation to increase the reliability and validity of the data.
11. participant’s observation involves becoming part of the community that is being studied.
12. The interaction among the members of the target community can be one of the variables looked into in an observation.
13. Observation should focus exclusively on the appearance of the community and people being observed.
14. It is important to ask help from experts in creating an interview or observation guide.
15. An informed consent form is a document required before conducting an interview or observation
16. Initial coding involves creating categories out of the gathered data.
17. Intermediate coding involves labelling concepts and terms using codes.
18. Advanced coding involves integrating categories created out of data into existing
theories.
19. Only the participants need to sign the informed consent form.
20. Tokens for participants should not cause undue influence on their behaviour
throughout the data collection procedure.</h2><br />

What is quantitative research?By definition, quantitative research is an objective, systematic empiricalinvestigation of observable phenomena through the use of computational techniques. Ithighlights numerical analysis of data hoping that the numbers yield unbiased results thatcan be generalized to some larger population and explain a particular observation(Faltado III et al., 2016)Moreover, Baraceros (2016) expounded that expressions like numerical forms,objective thinking, statistical methods, and measurement signal the existence ofquantitative research. It involves measurements and amounts and seeks to find answersto questions how many, how much, how long, to what extent and the like.Finding out how many students eat at the school canteen every lunch time, or howmuch allowance do senior high school students have every day is quantitative.Quantitative vs. QualitativeSo, how is quantitative research different from qualitative research? One word thatreflects the true nature of quantitative research is numerical. On the other hand,qualitative is subjective, interpretive, exploratory and requires heavy narratives.To be more specific, quantitative research deals with numbers, collects data whichcan be measured like length, height, area, volume, weight, speed, time, temperature,humidity, sound levels, costs, members, ages, scores, etc. while qualitative research dealswith description, and collects data which can be observed but not measured like colors,textures, smells, tastes, appearance, beauty, etc.Thus, you conduct a qualitative research when you want to know the commonthemes in Shakespeare's works but you conduct a quantitative research when you want toknow how many sonnets and plays he wrote.You employ quantitative research in finding out the IQ levels of the Grade 7students; however, you do qualitative research in describing the hardships andchallenges faced by the working students.Think about a headline you read from a newspaper, listened from a radio orwatched from the television.
