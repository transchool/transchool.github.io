Changes in languages15.According to Morga in his Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas (1609), In some parts of Luzon Islandthere are number of natives who are black in colour and with kinky hair, and neither sex is very tall although they are strong and husky. These are barbarians and of poor capacity. What can you say about this observation of de Morga? Are they accurate and objective? Why?a. Yes, because they don’t have an organized form of government, no formal schooling, dressed in their primitive attire and have no concept about their self and culture.b. Yes, because European people are more advanced in their science and technology. They are more civilized and educated.c. No, because their judgement is only based on their own observation and used their own culture as basis of comparison.d. No, because their observations do not conform with the ethnographic method used by anthropologists to better understand others’ culture.​</a>

These are barbarians and of poor capacity. What can you say about this observation of de Morga? Are they accurate and objective? Why?a. Yes, because they don’t have an organized form of government, no formal schooling, dressed in their primitive attire and have no concept about their self and culture.b. Yes, because European people are more advanced in their science and technology. They are more civilized and educated.c. No, because their judgement is only based on their own observation and used their own culture as basis of comparison.d.
