                        <p> </p><p>War is fascinating as well as appalling, and despite my abhorrence of the violence and destruction that is the essence of warfare I have been studying it in one context or another virtually my entire adult life. In the course of that study, I developed an interest in irregular warfare, particularly in the context of revolution. This work brings together in one place some of the results of the teaching, research, and writing I have done in the field over more than thirty years.</p><p></p><p>In 1986 I had the opportunity to give a series of six lectures at Obirin College in suburban Tokyo. Those lectures and the published papers and research on which the lectures were based provide the core of this work. Some editing has been done on the previously published essays for stylistic reasons or to avoid repetition. Footnotes and a few textual references have also been added to draw the reader’s attention to relevant works of particular merit published after the research for each essay was completed. In addition, a few alterations resulted from shifts in my own interpretive views over time. Finally, I have included a short introduction before many of the essays to provide some insight into the circumstances in which each was originally written or published.</p><p> </p><p></p><br />

Cavite Mutiny</h2><br />
                        <p>The Cavite Mutiny was a rebellion that took place in the Philippines in 1872. It was led by a group of Filipino soldiers and civilians who were disgruntled with their treatment by the Spanish colonial authorities. The mutiny was sparked by a number of grievances, including low pay, poor working conditions, and the perceived mistreatment of Filipino soldiers by their Spanish officers.</p><p></p><p>The Cavite Mutiny was a significant event in Philippine history as it marked the beginning of a long and often violent struggle for independence from Spanish rule. It also led to the execution of a number of Filipino soldiers and civilians, including three national heroes: Jose Rizal, Graciano Lopez Jaena, and Mariano Ponce.</p><p></p><p>However, there are conflicting views about the Cavite Mutiny and its significance in Philippine history. Some view it as an important event in the struggle for independence and a crucial moment in the country's history. Others, however, see it as a minor incident that was blown out of proportion and used by the colonial authorities as an excuse to crack down on dissent.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of the differing perspectives, the Cavite Mutiny remains an important part of Philippine history and is remembered as a significant moment in the country's struggle for independence and self-determination.</p><br />

Retraction of Rizal</h2><br />
                        <p>The Philippine history is a complex and multifaceted subject, with a rich and varied past that has given rise to a wide range of interpretations and perspectives. One of the most controversial and contested aspects of Philippine history relates to the figure of José Rizal, a national hero and writer who played a key role in the Philippine Revolution against Spanish colonial rule in the late 19th century.</p><p></p><p>Rizal has been the subject of much debate and controversy, with some interpreting his actions and writings as advocating for Philippine independence, while others view him as a collaborator with the colonial authorities. Some have even gone so far as to call for the retraction of Rizal's status as a national hero, arguing that his views and actions do not align with the values of the modern-day Philippines.</p><p></p><p>At the heart of these controversies is a fundamental disagreement about the nature of Rizal's activism and the motivations behind his actions. Some argue that Rizal was a true patriot who fought for the rights and freedoms of his fellow Filipinos, while others see him as a pawn of the colonial authorities who used his writings and actions to further their own interests.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of how one views Rizal, it is important to recognize that the history of the Philippines is complex and multifaceted, and that there are many different perspectives and interpretations of the events of the past. It is up to each individual to decide how they want to interpret and understand the history of the Philippines, and to respect the right of others to do the same.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>The Philippine history is a complex and multifaceted subject, and it is not surprising that there are many conflicting views and controversies surrounding it. Some of these controversies and conflicting views relate to the site of the first Mass in the Philippines, which is considered by some to be a significant event in the country's history.</p><p></p><p>According to some accounts, the first Mass in the Philippines was celebrated on the island of Cebu by the Spanish conquistador Ferdinand Magellan and the Spanish missionary Fray Pedro de Valderrama on Easter Sunday, March 31, 1521. This event is believed to have marked the beginning of the spread of Christianity in the Philippines. However, other accounts suggest that the first Mass may have been celebrated on the island of Limasawa, which is located south of Cebu.</p><p></p><p>The controversy surrounding the site of the first Mass is related to the fact that there are no written records of the event, and the accounts that do exist are based on oral traditions and second-hand accounts. Additionally, the accounts of the first Mass vary in their details, which further complicates the matter.</p><p></p><p>Some historians argue that the Mass was celebrated on Cebu, while others maintain that it took place on Limasawa.
