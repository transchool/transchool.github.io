I’ve known this since before I could go to school. As a toddler, my first study materials were a set of flash cards that my mother used to teach me the English alphabet.My mother made home conducive to learning English: all my storybooks and coloring books were in English, and so were the cartoons I watched and the music I listened to. She required me to speak English at home. She even hired tutors to help me learn to read and write in English.In school I learned to think in English. We used English to learn about numbers, equations and variables. With it we learned about observation and inference, the moon and the stars, monsoons and photosynthesis. With it we learned about shapes and colors, about meter and rhythm. I learned about God in English, and I prayed to Him in English.Filipino, on the other hand, was always the “other” subject – almost a special subject like PE or Home Economics, except that it was graded the same way as Science, Math, Religion and English. My classmates and I used to complain about Filipino all the time. Filipino was a chore, like washing the dishes; it was not the language of learning. It was the language we used to speak to the people who washed our dishes.We used to think learning Filipino was important because it was practical: Filipino was the language of the world outside the classroom. It was the language of the streets: it was how you spoke to the tindera when you went to the tindahan, what you used to tell your katulong that you had an utos, and how you texted manong when you needed “sundo na" These skills were required to survive in the outside world, because we are forced to relate with the tinderas and the manongs and the katulongs of this world. If we wanted to communicate to these people – or otherwise avoid being mugged on the jeepney – we needed to learn Filipino.That being said though, I was proud of my proficiency with the language. Filipino was the language I used to speak with my cousins and uncles and grandparents in the province, so I never had much trouble reciting.It was the reading and writing that was tedious and difficult. I spoke Filipino, but only when I was in a different world like the streets or the province; it did not come naturally to me. English was more natural; I read, wrote and thought in English. And so, in much of the same way that I learned German later on, I learned Filipino in terms of English. In this way I survived Filipino in high school, albeit with too many sentences that had the preposition “ay.”It was really only in university that I began to grasp Filipino in terms of language and not just dialect. Filipino was not merely a peculiar variety of language, derived and continuously borrowing from the English and Spanish alphabets; it was its own system, with its own grammar, semantics, sounds, even symbols.But more significantly, it was its own way of reading, writing and thinking. There are ideas and concepts unique to Filipino that can never be translated into another. Try translating bayanihan, tagay, kilig or diskarte.Only recently have I begun to grasp Filipino as the language of identity: the language of emotion, experience, and even of learning. And with this comes the realization that I do, in fact, smell worse than a malansang isda. My own language is foreign to me: I speak, think, read and write primarily in English. To borrow the terminology of Fr. Bulatao, I am a split-level Filipino.But perhaps this is not so bad in a society of rotten beef and stinking fish. For while Filipino may be the language of identity, it is the language of the streets. It might have the capacity to be the language of learning, but it is not the language of the learned.
It is neither the language of the classroom and the laboratory, nor the language of the boardroom, the court room, or the operating room. It is not the language of privilege. I may be disconnected from my being Filipino, but with a tongue of privilege I will always have my connections.So, I have my education to thank for making English mother touge Main PointsTextual EvidenceFact or Opinion1.2.3.4.5.1.2.3.4.5.1.2.3.4​</a>

                                            You are now finished with your lessons in text development. It is time for thefinal check up. This will be graded so take it seriously,Below is a text. Read it carefully and pay attention to details. After reading you willfind questions for you to answer briefly but concise.Each question is scored 5 points: two points for accuracy of answer and three forpresentation of evidence or reason write your answers in your activity notebook.The parol of Pampanga is a mix of Filipino and Spanish culture. TheSpanish introduced us to lanterns and their construction. The Filipinos thenmade use of indigenous materials and creativity to give it a "folk” touch. Asidefrom the form and aesthetic, it is the ritual behind the parol that Filipinoscan draw from. There is a team effort in its correction. The community comestogether to be able to fix the lights. If not, the lights will be all tangled. Agroup of people helping each other in order to reach the goal is a verybeautiful thingIt proves that there is a sense of community in the area. I think in manyplaces around the Philippines especially in Manila- there has been a loss ofthe sense of community. With the rise of capitalism and profit orientedmindset, it has become every man for himself. The sense of community needsto be restored in Filipino culture. Helping one another and the realization thatwe as Filipinos are all connected is important for national progress and theimprovement of the quality of life. I do not mean the kind of quality of life thatcomes out every year that ranks the best quality of life among countries. Imean the kind of quality of life where we can trust our neighbors. Like inBataan, there is a store with no "tindera" just a cash box to drop the cash in.Take what you want and drop the amount into the box. The ease that comesto mind when the door is unlocked but it is fine because the neighborhood issafe. The feeling of being able to depend on the people around you and yourcommunity when you need help- all these come from a sense of community.This is not something new to our culture.Source: The importance of Recognizing our Culture by Pammy Macasaet                                          Questions:1.

Qutput number 1: Read the excerpt from an article below, then in your intermediate paper, answer the questions that follow. Overdue jeepney fare hike rate to be released earliest next week' MANILA, Philippines - The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said that it expects to release the rate of the long-overdue jeepney fare hikes as early as next week. LTFRB Chairperson Cheloy Velicaria-Garafil said they are still weighing how much out of the P3 to P4 additional fare petition will be imposed on commuters. The regulatory board required jeepney groups to file a position paper or a memorandum within 15 days since their last hearing with the regulatory board held August 18. "We're waiting for their memorandum on September 3 and then we will act accordingly so we can expect that their rate hike petition resolution will happen at the earliest on the first week of September or, at the latest, second week of September," Velicaria-Garafil said in mixed English and Filipino during a briefing with reporters on Monday. Aside from jeepneys, the LTFRB is also looking at six other pending fare hike cases, including those from transportation network vehicle services, from taxi operators, point-to-point operators, UV Express services, and from bus operators Source: https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2022/08/29/2205932/overdue-jeepney-fare-hike-rate-be-released-earliest-next-week 1. What does fare hike mean? 2. What reason is mentioned in the article for imposing a fare hike? 3. How does this news affect you as a commuter and as a student? 4. Do you believe that the information presented is true or accurate? Why or why not? 5. As a student, what is the importance of reading this kind of material? Qutput number 2: Create your own quotation about Modern-day heroes. Be creative. Example: Beginning Tuesday, diesel prices across the country will see a P6.10-per-liter price hike. Velicaria-Garafil noted that the last time the regulatory board imposed a fare hike was when diesel cost around P44 per liter, half of what it costs now. Some transport groups have stopped plying their routes because their earnings can no longer keep up with operational costs as pump prices continue to increase. The government has launched a fuel subsidy program for public utility vehicle operators, but that has since ended for jeepney drivers. "NOT ALL HEROES FLY, SOME GOOK. HEAL, AND MAKE YOU ALWAYS TRY."

I’ve known this since before I could go to school. As a toddler, my first study materials were a set of flash cards that my mother used to teach me the English alphabet.My mother made home conducive to learning English: all my storybooks and coloring books were in English, and so were the cartoons I watched and the music I listened to. She required me to speak English at home. She even hired tutors to help me learn to read and write in English.In school I learned to think in English. We used English to learn about numbers, equations and variables. With it we learned about observation and inference, the moon and the stars, monsoons and photosynthesis. With it we learned about shapes and colors, about meter and rhythm. I learned about God in English, and I prayed to Him in English.Filipino, on the other hand, was always the “other” subject – almost a special subject like PE or Home Economics, except that it was graded the same way as Science, Math, Religion and English. My classmates and I used to complain about Filipino all the time. Filipino was a chore, like washing the dishes; it was not the language of learning. It was the language we used to speak to the people who washed our dishes.We used to think learning Filipino was important because it was practical: Filipino was the language of the world outside the classroom. It was the language of the streets: it was how you spoke to the tindera when you went to the tindahan, what you used to tell your katulong that you had an utos, and how you texted manong when you needed “sundo na" These skills were required to survive in the outside world, because we are forced to relate with the tinderas and the manongs and the katulongs of this world. If we wanted to communicate to these people – or otherwise avoid being mugged on the jeepney – we needed to learn Filipino.That being said though, I was proud of my proficiency with the language. Filipino was the language I used to speak with my cousins and uncles and grandparents in the province, so I never had much trouble reciting.It was the reading and writing that was tedious and difficult. I spoke Filipino, but only when I was in a different world like the streets or the province; it did not come naturally to me. English was more natural; I read, wrote and thought in English. And so, in much of the same way that I learned German later on, I learned Filipino in terms of English. In this way I survived Filipino in high school, albeit with too many sentences that had the preposition “ay.”It was really only in university that I began to grasp Filipino in terms of language and not just dialect. Filipino was not merely a peculiar variety of language, derived and continuously borrowing from the English and Spanish alphabets; it was its own system, with its own grammar, semantics, sounds, even symbols.But more significantly, it was its own way of reading, writing and thinking. There are ideas and concepts unique to Filipino that can never be translated into another. Try translating bayanihan, tagay, kilig or diskarte.Only recently have I begun to grasp Filipino as the language of identity: the language of emotion, experience, and even of learning. And with this comes the realization that I do, in fact, smell worse than a malansang isda. My own language is foreign to me: I speak, think, read and write primarily in English. To borrow the terminology of Fr. Bulatao, I am a split-level Filipino.But perhaps this is not so bad in a society of rotten beef and stinking fish. For while Filipino may be the language of identity, it is the language of the streets. It might have the capacity to be the language of learning, but it is not the language of the learned.
It is neither the language of the classroom and the laboratory, nor the language of the boardroom, the court room, or the operating room. It is not the language of privilege. I may be disconnected from my being Filipino, but with a tongue of privilege I will always have my connections.So, I have my education to thank for making English mother touge Main PointsTextual EvidenceFact or Opinion1.2.3.4.5.1.2.3.4.5.1.2.3.4​</h2><br />

Read it carefully and pay attention to details. After reading you willfind questions for you to answer briefly but concise.Each question is scored 5 points: two points for accuracy of answer and three forpresentation of evidence or reason write your answers in your activity notebook.The parol of Pampanga is a mix of Filipino and Spanish culture. TheSpanish introduced us to lanterns and their construction. The Filipinos thenmade use of indigenous materials and creativity to give it a "folk” touch. Asidefrom the form and aesthetic, it is the ritual behind the parol that Filipinoscan draw from. There is a team effort in its correction. The community comestogether to be able to fix the lights. If not, the lights will be all tangled. Agroup of people helping each other in order to reach the goal is a verybeautiful thingIt proves that there is a sense of community in the area. I think in manyplaces around the Philippines especially in Manila- there has been a loss ofthe sense of community. With the rise of capitalism and profit orientedmindset, it has become every man for himself. The sense of community needsto be restored in Filipino culture. Helping one another and the realization thatwe as Filipinos are all connected is important for national progress and theimprovement of the quality of life. I do not mean the kind of quality of life thatcomes out every year that ranks the best quality of life among countries. Imean the kind of quality of life where we can trust our neighbors. Like inBataan, there is a store with no "tindera" just a cash box to drop the cash in.Take what you want and drop the amount into the box. The ease that comesto mind when the door is unlocked but it is fine because the neighborhood issafe. The feeling of being able to depend on the people around you and yourcommunity when you need help- all these come from a sense of community.This is not something new to our culture.Source: The importance of Recognizing our Culture by Pammy Macasaet                                          Questions:1.

Qutput number 1: Read the excerpt from an article below, then in your intermediate paper, answer the questions that follow. Overdue jeepney fare hike rate to be released earliest next week' MANILA, Philippines - The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said that it expects to release the rate of the long-overdue jeepney fare hikes as early as next week. LTFRB Chairperson Cheloy Velicaria-Garafil said they are still weighing how much out of the P3 to P4 additional fare petition will be imposed on commuters. The regulatory board required jeepney groups to file a position paper or a memorandum within 15 days since their last hearing with the regulatory board held August 18. "We're waiting for their memorandum on September 3 and then we will act accordingly so we can expect that their rate hike petition resolution will happen at the earliest on the first week of September or, at the latest, second week of September," Velicaria-Garafil said in mixed English and Filipino during a briefing with reporters on Monday. Aside from jeepneys, the LTFRB is also looking at six other pending fare hike cases, including those from transportation network vehicle services, from taxi operators, point-to-point operators, UV Express services, and from bus operators Source: https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2022/08/29/2205932/overdue-jeepney-fare-hike-rate-be-released-earliest-next-week 1. What does fare hike mean? 2. What reason is mentioned in the article for imposing a fare hike? 3. How does this news affect you as a commuter and as a student? 4. Do you believe that the information presented is true or accurate? Why or why not? 5. As a student, what is the importance of reading this kind of material? Qutput number 2: Create your own quotation about Modern-day heroes. Be creative. Example: Beginning Tuesday, diesel prices across the country will see a P6.10-per-liter price hike. Velicaria-Garafil noted that the last time the regulatory board imposed a fare hike was when diesel cost around P44 per liter, half of what it costs now. Some transport groups have stopped plying their routes because their earnings can no longer keep up with operational costs as pump prices continue to increase. The government has launched a fuel subsidy program for public utility vehicle operators, but that has since ended for jeepney drivers. "NOT ALL HEROES FLY, SOME GOOK. HEAL, AND MAKE YOU ALWAYS TRY."
