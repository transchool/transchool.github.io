                                            Laura is the associate director of a nonprofit agency that provides assistance to children and families. She is the head of a department that focuses on evaluating the skill-building programs the agency provides to families. She reports directly to the agency leadership. As a whole, the agency has been cautious in hiring this year because of increased competition for federal grant funding. However, they have also suffered high staff turnover. Two directors, three key research staff, and one staff person from the finance department have left.Laura has a demanding schedule that requires frequent travel; however, she supervises two managers who in turn are responsible for five staff members each. Both managers have been appointed within the last six months. Manager 1: Kelly has a specific background in research. She manages staff who provide research support to another department that delivers behavioral health services to youth. Kelly supports her staff and is very organized; however, she often takes a very black and white view of issues. Upper level leadership values Kelly’s latest research on the therapeutic division’s services. Kelly is very motivated and driven and expects the same from her staff. Manager 2: Linda has a strong background in social science research and evaluation. She manages staff that work on different projects within the agency. She is known as a problem solver and is extremely supportive of her staff. She is very organized and has a wealth of experience in evaluation of family services. Linda is very capable and can sometimes take on too much.The managers are sensing that staff are becoming overworked as everyone takes on increased responsibilities due to high staff turnover. Staff have also mentioned that Laura’s "glass half-empty" conversation style leaves them feeling dejected. In addition, Laura has not shared budgets with her managers, so they are having difficulty appropriately allocating work to staff. Laura said she has not received sufficient information from the finance department to complete the budgets. The finance department said they have sent her all the information they have available. As staff become distressed, the managers are becoming frustrated. They feel like they are unable to advocate for their staff or solve problems without key information like the departmental budget. DISCUSSION QUESTIONS: 1. How can Laura most effectively use both management and leadership skills in her role as associate director? What combination of the two do you think would work best in this setting? 2. What steps could be taken to build staff confidence? 3. What advice would you give Laura on improving her leadership skills and to the managers on improving their management skills? *</a>

CASE	STUDY	5: A	SECOND	CHANCE Lynn's	Bistro,	a	longtime	fixture	on	the	food	scene	just	outside	of	a	large	mid-western city,	had	finally	 completed	 a	major	 renovation	 of	 its	 kitchen.	 The	 bistro	 had	 been	 open	 for	 44	 years,	 and,	except	 for	 some	 repairs	along	the	way,	not	much	had	been	done	to	improve	the	facilities	in	the	back	of	the	house.	The	kitchen	 staff	was	thrilled	that	the	renovation	work	was	nearly	complete. Chase,	a young	kitchen	manager	and	Lynn's	great	grandson,	jumped	at	the	chance	to	review	how	food	 storage	should	be	done	in	the	newly	renovated	space.	He	set	out	to	do	a	complete	food	storage	review.	Chase	 and	his	 staff	were	determined	 to	 start	 fresh	and	ensure	 that	 they	 followed	good	 food	 storage	guidelines	as	 they	prepared	for	the	reopening	of	their	kitchen When	answering	your	case	study,	use	these	questions	as	a	guide.	Please	make	sure	that	the	answers	to	 the	guide	questions	are	reflected	in	your	case	analysis. 1) List	some	things	that	Chase	and	his	staff	should consider	as	they	conduct	a	review	of	the	new storage	 area.

                            9. Laura is the associate director of a nonprofit agency that provides assistance to children and families. She is the head of a department that focuses on evaluating the skill-building programs the agency provides to families. She reports directly to the agency leadership. As a whole, the agency has been cautious in hiring this year because of increased competition for federal grant funding. However, they have also suffered high staff turnover. Two directors, three key research staff, and one staff person from the finance department have left.Laura has a demanding schedule that requires frequent travel; however, she supervises two managers who in turn are responsible for five staff members each. Both managers have been appointed within the last six months. Manager 1: Kelly has a specific background in research. She manages staff who provide research support to another department that delivers behavioral health services to youth. Kelly supports her staff and is very organized; however, she often takes a very black and white view of issues. Upper level leadership values Kelly’s latest research on the therapeutic division’s services. Kelly is very motivated and driven and expects the same from her staff. Manager 2: Linda has a strong background in social science research and evaluation. She manages staff that work on different projects within the agency. She is known as a problem solver and is extremely supportive of her staff. She is very organized and has a wealth of experience in evaluation of family services. Linda is very capable and can sometimes take on too much.The managers are sensing that staff are becoming overworked as everyone takes on increased responsibilities due to high staff turnover. Staff have also mentioned that Laura’s "glass half-empty" conversation style leaves them feeling dejected. In addition, Laura has not shared budgets with her managers, so they are having difficulty appropriately allocating work to staff. Laura said she has not received sufficient information from the finance department to complete the budgets. The finance department said they have sent her all the information they have available. As staff become distressed, the managers are becoming frustrated. They feel like they are unable to advocate for their staff or solve problems without key information like the departmental budget. DISCUSSION QUESTIONS: 1. How can Laura most effectively use both management and leadership skills in her role as associate director? What combination of the two do you think would work best in this setting? 2. What steps could be taken to build staff confidence? 3. What advice would you give Laura on improving her leadership skills and to the managers on improving their management skills? *</h2><br />

He	set	out	to	do	a	complete	food	storage	review.
