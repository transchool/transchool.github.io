                            5. in 1868, when authority was restored to the emperor, he gave himself the name “Meiji,” which means “enlightened rule.” Do you think this is an appropriate name for the emperor and for this era in Japanese history? Explain.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>At the time of Emperor Meiji's birth in 1852, Japan was a feudal, pre-industrial country dominated by the isolationist Tokugawa shogunate and the daimyōs subject to it, who ruled over the country's more than 250 decentralized domains.[citation needed] By the time of his death in 1912, Japan had undergone an extensive political, economic and social revolution, and emerged as one of the great powers on the world stage. The New York Times summarized this transformation at the Emperor's funeral in 1912 with the words: "the contrast between that which preceded the funeral car and that which followed it was striking indeed. Before it went old Japan; after it came new Japan."[1]</p><p></p><p>Since the modern era, when an Emperor of Japan dies he is given a posthumous name. Such a name is a combination of the era during which he reigned and coincides with the Emperor's contribution to the throne whilst he was alive. Therefore, while publicly known during his life merely as "The Emperor", he is historically known as "Emperor Meiji" after his death.[b] He obtained this current title in reference to the Meiji era, which spanned almost the entirety of his reign. His personal name (which is not used in any formal or official context, except for his signature) was Mutsuhito </p><br />

                            29. For christmas brad gave his friends pickled papaya he made canned himself. Several days after he gave away his gift. His friend were sent to the hospital for contracting botulism. Botulism is caused by Botulinum, a bacterium that produces toxins.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>The microorganisms Clostridium botulinum, Clostridium butyricum, and Clostridium baratii produce these toxins. These bacteria can create poisons in the food, wounds, and intestines of newborns. </strong>The bacteria that produce botulinum toxin are prevalent in nature, but they rarely cause illness in humans.</p><p>Incorrectly home-canned foods are a common source of foodborne botulism. However, modern industrial canning procedures eliminate C. botulinum spores, rendering commercially canned foods far less likely to be a source of botulism.</p><p>Due to the fact that pickled vegetables and fruits, in this example, papaya, are covered in an acidified brine, the procedure provides an acidity level sufficient to prevent botulism.</p><p>Adding enough vinegar to the papaya (or other vegetables/fruits) is vital for producing safe pickles. Clostridium botulinum can thrive in badly preserved, pickled foods with a pH above 4.6. <strong>In order to assure the safety of any kind varieties of pickles, it is essential to utilize scientifically validated recipes.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Learn more about bacteria:</strong></p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/451917</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>#SPJ1</strong></p><br />
