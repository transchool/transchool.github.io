                        <p>For me... the story... makes me realize that we are all born equally... no matter what is your color... it also want us to learn that God make their hands white because just like the others... we do the same thing </p><p></p><br />

                            3. The Hands on the black</h2><br />
                        EXCERPT<br /><br />I don't remember now how we got onto the subject, but one day Teacher said that the palms of the black's hands were much lighter than the rest of their bodies because only a few centuries ago they walked around on all fours, like wild animals, so their palms weren't exposed to the sun, which made the rest of their bodies darker and darker. I thought of this when Father Christiano told us after catechism that we were absolutely hopeless, and that even the blacks were better than us, and he went back to this thing about their hands being lighter, and said it was like that because they always went about with their hands folded together, praying in secret. I thought this was so funny, this thing of the black's hands being lighter, that you should just see me now — I don't let go of anyone, whoever they are, until they tell me why they think that the palms of the black's hands are lighter. Dona Dores, for instance, told me that God made their hands lighter like that so they wouldn't dirty food they made for their masters, or anything else they were ordered to do that had to be kept quite clean.<br /><br />We read it in We Killed Mangy-Dog &amp; Other Mozambique stories.<br />

                        <strong>Answer:</strong>Because the mother is the only one who must be right about this question of a Black’s hands being lighter than the rest of his body.<p></p> On the day that they were talking about it, he/she was telling her what he/she already knew about the question, and she could not stop laughing. When he/she was talking, she did not tell me at once what she thought about all this and she only talked when she was sure that i wouldn’t get tired of bothering her about it.<p></p> And even then,  she was crying and clutching herself around the stomach like someone who had laughed so much that it was quite unbearable.  <p></p>"After telling me all this, my mother kissed my hands. As i ran off to the yard to play ball, i thought that i had never seen a person cry so much as my mother did then."<p></p><strong>Explanation:</strong><p>Hope this helped :D</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The full story “The hands of the Black” by Bernardo Honwana takes only a couple of minutes to read, but it needs much more time to think it over. The story starts from the simple question a schoolboy he asks just out of curiosity, but the answers turn it to something much more complicated. The comprehension of the questions the adults ask in return and the answers they give can say a lot about the world of racial discrimination.</p><p></p><p>The question about the hands of the black people is firstly raised by the narrator’s schoolteacher and then the most offensive explanation possible is given to the class. According to the teacher, the black people didn’t evolved as fast as the white ones, so the palms without tan is a memory about the times when they were walking on their four like monkeys.</p><p></p><p>The first disturbing thing in the story is that the narrator (who is probably Bernardo Honwana himself) is the only one who disagrees with this explanation and starts to seek another answers from random people. But still, none of them satisfies him, because – this is the second thing that makes us worry – people claim that black people as a race have some special traits that distinguish them from whites, that they have different personalities.</p><p></p><p>The priest – the next man the narrator asks and the one who has the most authority among the neighboring adults – gives much prettier explanation, but it still looks fake. He says that God left the hands of the black people light-colored because they hold them together during the prayer so often that the skin has no time to become tanned.</p><p></p><p>This version, on the contrary, makes black people better than whites and more obedient to God – but by intuition or logic the narrator understands that it isn’t true either. So he continues his quest for answers, trying to comprehend why adults have such different versions of them.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                            22. summary of the hands of the blacks</h2><br />
                        "The Hands of the Blacks" is a short story by Luis Bernardo Honwana. The story follows the narrator as heasks different people to explain the reason why the hands of black people are lighter than the rest of theirbodies. First he speaks to his teacher, who tells him that their hands are lighter because humans once crawledon the ground like four legged animals, leaving their palms unexposed to the light. Next, the narrator speaks tothree religious men, Father Christiano, Señor Antunes, and Señor Frias, who provide him with differentreligious explanations. The narrator then says that he once read a book that explained the phenomenon as theoutcome of slaves picking cotton in Virginia. Finally, the narrator speaks with his mother, who tells him thatGod created black people without lighter hands, but once he saw how they were mistreated by white people, helightened their palms. The mother says that he did this to show that while black people looked different, theirwork for God was just as important and valuable. His mother cries and leaves him to reflect on her words.<br /><br />

                            23. the story of hands of the blacks</h2><br />
                        I don't remember now how we got onto the subject, but one day Teacher said that the palms of the black's hands were much lighter than the rest of their bodies because only a few centuries ago they walked around on all fours, like wild animals, so their palms weren't exposed to the sun, which made the rest of their bodies darker and darker. I thought of this when Father Christiano told us after catechism that we were absolutely hopeless, and that even the blacks were better than us, and he went back to this thing about their hands being lighter, and said it was like that because they always went about with their hands folded together, praying in secret. I thought this was so funny, this thing of the black's hands being lighter, that you should just see me now — I don't let go of anyone, whoever they are, until they tell me why they think that the palms of the black's hands are lighter. Dona Dores, for instance, told me that God made their hands lighter like that so they wouldn't dirty food they made for their masters, or anything else they were ordered to do that had to be kept quite clean.<br /><br /><br />
