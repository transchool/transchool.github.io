The outspoken leader last week made a similar remark about using petrol on masks if cleaning agents were unavailable, which his spokesman said was a joke and reminded the public that Duterte often says things in jest "What I said is true," Duterte said during a televised address on Friday. "Just go to the gasoline station, and then have some drops, that's disinfectant." He added: "I am not joking. That is true. You think I am just kidding." Mask-wearing has since March been mandatory in the Philippines, which has confirmed nearly 90,000 coronavirus infections and more than 2,000 deaths. It reported Southeast Asia's biggest daily jump in new coronavirus cases for a second straight day on Friday, as Duterte extended restrictions to quell the spread, and promised normality would return in December. Medical experts said his mask cleaning tips were not recommended. "You cannot use gasoline as disinfectant. Inhaling it may cause harm and could lead to more problems like respiratory disease," Jose Santiago, President of the Philippine Medical Association, told Reuters. Health experts recommend soap and water for cleaning reusable cloth masks, and 70% ethyl or isopropyl alcohol for proper disinfection. The first time Duterte suggested using petrol on masks, some opponents blasted him what they called dangerous advice. ❗ PLEASE ANSWER PROPERLY ❗​​</a>

                            12. Article 1 Philippines President Duterte says to use petrol to disinfect face masks &amp; he's not joking; Medical experts have since refuted his claims By: Julia Yeo Published August 01, 2020 President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte reiterated in a televised address on July 31 that petrol can be used for disinfecting face masks if cleaning agents were unavailable. Spokesman said Duterte was joking, Duterte says he's not "What I said is true," Duterte said. "Just go to the gasoline station, and then have some drops, that's disinfectant." His spokesman had attempted to clarify previously that what the leader said was a joke, reminding the public that Duterte often says things in jest, after he made a similar remark last week, according to Reuters. Duterte claimed during a public broadcast on July 21 that that flammable liquids like petrol could be used to clean face masks if cleaning materials prove to be too expensive. "At the end of the day, hang it somewhere and spray it with Lysol if you can afford it," Duterte said. Philippines health department and health experts refute Duterte's claims The country's Department of Health quickly issued a correction, suggesting that the president was joking and that residents should not take the advice seriously. "Cloth masks should be washed every day, after every use. It should be washed, and dried (under) the sun," the health undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said to reporters, according to Yahoo Philippines. Medical experts have also since refuted his claims, and said that his mask cleaning tips were not recommended. "You cannot use gasoline as disinfectant. Inhaling it may cause harm and could lead to more problems like respiratory disease," Jose Santiago, President of the Philippine Medical Association, told Reuters. It has been mandatory to wear masks in the Philippines since March 2020. The country has over 85,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and close to 2,000 deaths. Article 2 Philippines' Duterte recommends petrol to clean face masks, says 'not joking' By: World News Staff Published July 31, 2020 MANILA (Reuters) Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte on Friday told his people they should use gasoline as a disinfectant for protective face masks and stressed that his advice was not a joke. The outspoken leader last week made a similar remark about using petrol on masks if cleaning agents were unavailable, which his spokesman said was a joke and reminded the public that Duterte often says things in jest "What I said is true," Duterte said during a televised address on Friday. "Just go to the gasoline station, and then have some drops, that's disinfectant." He added: "I am not joking. That is true. You think I am just kidding." Mask-wearing has since March been mandatory in the Philippines, which has confirmed nearly 90,000 coronavirus infections and more than 2,000 deaths. It reported Southeast Asia's biggest daily jump in new coronavirus cases for a second straight day on Friday, as Duterte extended restrictions to quell the spread, and promised normality would return in December. Medical experts said his mask cleaning tips were not recommended. "You cannot use gasoline as disinfectant. Inhaling it may cause harm and could lead to more problems like respiratory disease," Jose Santiago, President of the Philippine Medical Association, told Reuters. Health experts recommend soap and water for cleaning reusable cloth masks, and 70% ethyl or isopropyl alcohol for proper disinfection. The first time Duterte suggested using petrol on masks, some opponents blasted him what they called dangerous advice. ❗ PLEASE ANSWER PROPERLY ❗​​</h2><br />

                            30. UN Women responds to COVID-19 in South Asia In April, COVID-19 cases began skyrocketing in South Asia, severely straining health systems. While caseloads have finally begun to slow, the sheer number of people falling ill has left hospitals running out of beds, oxygen, and medication, even as vaccine shortages persist The health, social and economic impacts are expected to be long-lasting, particularly for already vulnerable groups, including many women as well as children and youth, persons with disabilities, socially excluded people, and others. With fewer options to manage the crisis, they may be forced to adopt negative strategies to cope with risks and pressures. UN Women and its partners are providing critical support to women and their families to survive the pandemic, sustaining services, extending supplies and information, and advocating for gender-responsive strategies to respond to the crisis and recover in the aftermath. https://asiapacific.urwomen.org/en/news-and-vertalin-focusgender-equality-in-cond-19-responsagolideAlaloobchalins5140RFCH2YHOMEAAYASAREL.
