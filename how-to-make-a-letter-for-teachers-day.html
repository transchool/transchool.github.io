                                            Dear Brando,My teacher in MAPEH asked me to participate in improving our school garden using recyclable materials to lessen the garbage of our school and ask me to make an action plan. Since our teacher asked me to focus in garden recycled ideas, I wanted to know the impact of recycling plastic bottles to our Gulayan sa Paaralan in reducing the school garbage. Through this idea, I will be able to recycle plastic bottles inschool and use it as main material in improving the school garden.To achieve this target, our group planned to collect plastic bottles during our free time. Plastic bottles will be arranged according to the landscape design presented by our group once we gather all the materials we needed. Other members will plant vegetable seedlings to the recycled bottles which will be filled into the design. We also divided our group to check the development of our project and to water the plants every day.I am thankful to our teacher that she had given us the opportunity to help in lessening the garbage in our school. I hope that it will give inspiration to other students to do their parts in saving and protecting our environment. When we reach our target, other students will realize the importance of recycling in lessening the environmental problems of our society and at the same time students will enjoy the feeding program of vegetables harvested from recycled plastic bottles in the Gulayan sa Paaralan.To make the task easier, our teacher divided our class into five groups, and we were assigned as Group A. She also emphasized that the project shall start from September and will culminate on November. We also presented materials needed and itscost such as twine for 800 pesos, 1 sack of vermi cast for 400 pesos and seedlings for500 pesos. We also ask for the help of our Gulayan sa Paaralan Coordinator and theDepartment of Agriculture in our locality to supervise our project.I hope that through this activity, all of us will take part in protecting our mother earth.How about you? Hope to know also from you, the soonest.Your friend, BridgetteProcess Questions:1. What is the community problem presented in the letter?2. Do you have the same problem in your school?3. How do you address this problem in your school?​</a>

                            25. Dear Brando,My teacher in MAPEH asked me to participate in improving our school garden using recyclable materials to lessen the garbage of our school and ask me to make an action plan. Since our teacher asked me to focus in garden recycled ideas, I wanted to know the impact of recycling plastic bottles to our Gulayan sa Paaralan in reducing the school garbage. Through this idea, I will be able to recycle plastic bottles inschool and use it as main material in improving the school garden.To achieve this target, our group planned to collect plastic bottles during our free time. Plastic bottles will be arranged according to the landscape design presented by our group once we gather all the materials we needed. Other members will plant vegetable seedlings to the recycled bottles which will be filled into the design. We also divided our group to check the development of our project and to water the plants every day.I am thankful to our teacher that she had given us the opportunity to help in lessening the garbage in our school. I hope that it will give inspiration to other students to do their parts in saving and protecting our environment. When we reach our target, other students will realize the importance of recycling in lessening the environmental problems of our society and at the same time students will enjoy the feeding program of vegetables harvested from recycled plastic bottles in the Gulayan sa Paaralan.To make the task easier, our teacher divided our class into five groups, and we were assigned as Group A. She also emphasized that the project shall start from September and will culminate on November. We also presented materials needed and itscost such as twine for 800 pesos, 1 sack of vermi cast for 400 pesos and seedlings for500 pesos. We also ask for the help of our Gulayan sa Paaralan Coordinator and theDepartment of Agriculture in our locality to supervise our project.I hope that through this activity, all of us will take part in protecting our mother earth.How about you? Hope to know also from you, the soonest.Your friend, BridgetteProcess Questions:1. What is the community problem presented in the letter?2. Do you have the same problem in your school?3.
