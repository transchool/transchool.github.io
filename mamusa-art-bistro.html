CASE	STUDY	5: A	SECOND	CHANCE Lynn's	Bistro,	a	longtime	fixture	on	the	food	scene	just	outside	of	a	large	mid-western city,	had	finally	 completed	 a	major	 renovation	 of	 its	 kitchen.	 The	 bistro	 had	 been	 open	 for	 44	 years,	 and,	except	 for	 some	 repairs	along	the	way,	not	much	had	been	done	to	improve	the	facilities	in	the	back	of	the	house.	The	kitchen	 staff	was	thrilled	that	the	renovation	work	was	nearly	complete. Chase,	a young	kitchen	manager	and	Lynn's	great	grandson,	jumped	at	the	chance	to	review	how	food	 storage	should	be	done	in	the	newly	renovated	space.	He	set	out	to	do	a	complete	food	storage	review.	Chase	 and	his	 staff	were	determined	 to	 start	 fresh	and	ensure	 that	 they	 followed	good	 food	 storage	guidelines	as	 they	prepared	for	the	reopening	of	their	kitchen When	answering	your	case	study,	use	these	questions	as	a	guide.	Please	make	sure	that	the	answers	to	 the	guide	questions	are	reflected	in	your	case	analysis. 1) List	some	things	that	Chase	and	his	staff	should consider	as	they	conduct	a	review	of	the	new storage	 area.

The	kitchen	 staff	was	thrilled	that	the	renovation	work	was	nearly	complete.

He	set	out	to	do	a	complete	food	storage	review.	Chase	 and	his	 staff	were	determined	 to	 start	 fresh	and	ensure	 that	 they	 followed	good	 food	 storage	guidelines	as	 they	prepared	for	the	reopening	of	their	kitchen When	answering	your	case	study,	use	these	questions	as	a	guide.	Please	make	sure	that	the	answers	to	 the	guide	questions	are	reflected	in	your	case	analysis. 1) List	some	things	that	Chase	and	his	staff	should consider	as	they	conduct	a	review	of	the	new storage	 area.
