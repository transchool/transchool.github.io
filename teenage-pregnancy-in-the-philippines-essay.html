                        TEENAGE PREGNANCY ESSAY (786 words)<br /><br />Pregnancy in girls aged 19 or below is termed as teenage pregnancy. There are many social, emotional and health problems associated with teenage pregnancy. Even though increased awareness about sexual health and greater used of condoms has brought down the cases of teenage pregnancy in countries like U.S., the responsible factors like low education standards, poverty, inappropriate knowledge of sex amongst adolescents contributes to cases of teenage pregnancy.<br /><br />Some developing nations are faced with problems of early marriage and non-awareness about contraceptives which also contributes to cases of teenage pregnancy.<br /><br />ADVERTISEMENTS:<br /><br />Since unplanned sexual intercourse is more common in age group 12-14 who are not aware of protected sex, the concern becomes grave for younger girls who get pregnant. If an adolescent girl gets pregnant in such an early age, abortion is one option to be considered if the pregnancy is tested and detected in time.<br /><br />In cases where girl is in later adolescence, adoption or support of community to raise the child are some ways to help the teen pregnant emotionally and also if she is financially incapable of nurturing a child. It is highly important to seek support from parents of the girl or the father of the expected child so that appropriate prenatal care can be offered. It is essential that teenage mothers stay away from smoking, drug abuse and so on.<br /><br />Teenage mothers may not be educated enough and have complete awareness about precautions to be taken during pregnancy. It becomes therefore essential to offer education and community support to such young girls and also create awareness about contraception to keep them safe from any such experience later upon.<br /><br />Pregnancy in teenage is also a very troubling time for parents of the teenager who have dreamt a bright future ahead for their children. However since the teenager who gets pregnant also undergoes feelings of anger and frustration for the situation that has arrived, it is important that parents keep their anger in control so as to reduce the adolescent’s stress.<br /><br />ADVERTISEMENTS:<br /><br />The parents should get complete medical check up done for the child by a qualified physician in the field and ensure that she gets counseling as well from outside if needed to overcome emotional stress. If both the families of the girl and boy are ready to raise the child properly, it is good. Else adoption should be chosen as the way where some appropriate organization should be chosen to adopt the child.<br /><br />Teenage pregnancy is not socially acceptable in many communities and cultures and therefore the social problems needed to be considered besides giving medical and pre-natal care to the expecting adolescent girl. Children who are born to teenage parents are more likely to face problems with good education because social support may lack in their case. If appropriate community support is offered through child-care support and social services, such children can also get good education and settle as independently earning individuals in the society.<br /><br />A teenage pregnancy is certainly debilitating for the girl child who is often faced with societal and family pressure because of the indiscretion that resulted into her pregnancy. If a teenage girl suffers all the hostility from friends and family, she is not likely to understand and know the aspects of nutrition associated with pregnancy and may give birth to low-weight or malnourished child. Behavioral problems are also common in such children as they do not get to witness the right parental skills that they can imitate.<br /><br />Teen pregnancy becomes an issue of embarrassment for most parents and as a result they do not find it easy to accept the situation and deal with it positively and patiently. Moreover a teen girl is also not bodily prepared to give birth to a child that adds to all other problems that she faces.<br /><br />ADVERTISEMENTS:<br /><br />It is important that such teen parents reenter educational institutions after giving birth to the child so that they can be educated about being better parents in rearing their child. Child care should be accessible and within financial reach of such teen mothers. Many teen parents begin to abuse their children as early as 6 months of age if they also suffered abuse as children. Even more there are higher chances of death associated with teenage pregnancy for the mother as well as the child.<br /><br />Therefore early prenatal care is essential to save the child as well as mother from any complications or serious medical conditions.<br /><br />Teen pregnancy prevention programs like abstinence education, knowledge based programs that guide them about their bodies, clinic focused programs for easier access to sex education and peer counseling programs are some measures that can help control the teenage pregnancy rates in the world.<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The main reason of teenage pregnancy is the lack of parental guidance. Nowadays, teens do what they see in social medias and other medias that they think is cool. Another reason is the lack of sex education. We need to enlighten the teens because this generation is so much different than the others because teens now are more curious and bolder about doing such things.</p><br />

                        Teenage pregnancy is now one of the biggest problem of the country. Most of the teenagers are students who became really curious about “sex” to the point they done some adventure and do it with a person who’s not ready too, to build a family. And it’s one of the problem too, because they can’t provide anything for the family. Teenage pregnancy should stop as soon as possible. Parents should look up to their sons and daughter, while it’s still early they should teach lessons to their children for them not to be that curious. Teenagers is on puberty their hormones is high so as a parent you should be strict <br />

                        <p>As time goes on, teen pregnancy is becoming more and more common throughout the world. So many people frown upon this whole idea. Such people act as if the teenage parents’ world is going to come to an end. Although these kids’ life is going to be making a big turn, there are many of them who are mature enough to take on the responsibilities of a baby. As the medical field advances, the ways to avoid teen pregnancy goes up as well. There are ways such as abortion, plan B pills, and birth control. Some people use this because they know they are not ready to become parents, which I feel is a good and responsible choice. On the other hand, those who use these methods as a way to technically “kill” the unborn is what should be frowned upon instead.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        Teen pregnancy is something that has been around for ages, and isn’t all that uncommon. As of 2006, out of a million teens between the ages 15-19 three quarters of them end up pregnant every year. Out of all those teens, only a very few planned on becoming teen mothers. Through my interviews I have learned just how difficult and life changing becoming pregnant and having a baby as a teen can be. The best thing for teens to do is wait to have a baby, because having a baby this young is a lot more difficult than it looks. <br /><br />“Having a baby this young is not easy. Even though you might have your parents to help you, it’s still really hard. School becomes overly stressful and your friends drop really fast. And the boy who promised to be there forever finds a new girl. It changes your life and creates many obstacles” - Nicole. Being a teen mom you don’t get the high school or even college experiences you would have gotten if you had waited. Statistics show that most teenagers who become pregnant do not end up going to college. Girls who become pregnant as teens who had planned on going to college and getting an education have to figure out alternative solutions such as going to community college or taking classes online. The best things for teens to do is wait, wait to have a baby. Its better for them to just enjoy high school and college so they can have that experience. <br /><br />Most teen girls who end up getting pregnant and having a baby are not ready physically or mentally. <br />“Teenage years are already feel like your being judged by everyone, add a big belly and it all gets worse” - Cathy. Teens who become pregnant get looked down upon and are judged by so many people, which makes things more difficult. Plus most teen girls who end up pregnant think that just because they have a baby, the dad will stay. However in all my interviews, each lady stated how the guy left. Having a baby means growing up and taking on many responsibilities, which many teens are not ready to do at such a young age. “The second you find out your having a baby, you have to grow up right then” - Nicole. Getting pregnant as a teen changes your whole life, your forced to grow up. The best thing teens can do is to wait and just enjoy being a kid while they still can be one. One day they will have to grow up, but it doesn’t have to so soon.<br />

                            18. Causes of teenage pregnancy in the philippines</h2><br />
                         <strong>Overview </strong><br />Teenage pregnancy is defined as an unintended pregnancy during adolescence. Approximately 750,000 of 15- to 19-year-olds become pregnant each year, according to The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, though many teenagers do not believe that they will get pregnant if they engage in sexual activity. <br /> <strong>Peer Pressure</strong><br />During adolescence, teenagers often feel pressure to make friends and fit in with their peers. Many times these teens let their friends influence their decision to have sex even when they do not fully understand the consequences associated with the act. Teenagers have sex as a way to appear cool and sophisticated, but in some cases the end result is an unplanned teen pregnancy. The Kaiser Family Foundation states that more than 29 percent of pregnant teens reported that they felt pressured to have sex, and 33 percent of pregnant teens stated that they felt that they were not ready for a sexual relationship, but proceeded anyway because they feared ridicule or rejection. <br /><strong>Absent Parents </strong><br />Teen girls are more likely to get pregnant if the have limited or no guidance from their parents. Many parents have busy lives that prevent them from providing the guidance and support that their young teenagers need to make good decisions on issues such as sex, according to the website Parent Dish. When a teen does not feel that she can talk to her parents about sex either because they forbid sex talk or because they are not around, she will more than likely turn to friends for direction on whether or not to have sex, resulting in misinformation and possible teen pregnancy.   <br />   <strong>Glamorization of Pregnancy</strong><strong></strong><br />The movie industry and the media contribute to teenage pregnancy by glamorizing teen pregnancy in news stories and movies. Movies that depict teen pregnancy as something to be desired encourage teens to engage in reckless sexual activity, according to ABC's "Good Morning America." During adolescence, teens become more focused on their appearance and how their peers perceive them. They want to be seen as part of the group, so if teen pregnancy is viewed as acceptable in their school or amongst their friends, they may seek to become pregnant as a way to gain social acceptance.  <br /><strong>Lack of Knowledge </strong><br />Teenagers who are uneducated about sex are more likely to have an unintended pregnancy. Some teens do not fully understand the biological and emotional aspects associated with having sex, according to DailyRecord.co.uk. These teens may get incorrect information from friends, videos, sitcoms and/or movies. Many times, teens do not have the knowledge needed to make informed and responsible decisions about whether or not to engage in sexual activity that can alter their life. <br />  <strong>Sexual Abuse or Rape </strong><br />Teens can become pregnant as a result of sexual abuse or rape. The Guttmacher Institute states that between 43 and 62 percent of teens acknowledge that they were impregnated by an adult male, and two-thirds report that their babies' fathers are as old as 27. Approximately 5 percent of all teen births are the result of a rape.  <br /><strong>Teenage Drinking </strong><br />Teen drinking can cause an unexpected pregnancy, according to the website Love to Know. Many teens experiment with drugs and alcohol. Drinking lowers a teen’s ability to control her impulses, contributing to 75 percent of pregnancies that occur between the ages 14 and 21. Approximately 91 percent of pregnant teens reported that although they were drinking at the time, they did not originally plan to have sex when they conceived. <br /><br /><br /><br />

                        There are more than 16.5 million Filipinos are impregnated from ages 15-24.30% of the babies born are from this group. Before becoming 20 Yrs. old, 25% are already pregnant. Many young mothers have fallen to depression during and after pregnancy. Some fell into the abyss and got addicted to illegal drugs. When impregnated teenage girls decides to abort the baby, they may suffer some health complications such as internal bleeding in the womb, developing cancer in the womb, and some even died in the process and after the process. Many impregnated teenage girls have been pulled away from education because of pregnancy and mostly doesn't have jobs to support their child's growth. <br />

These teenage mothers are predominantly poor, reside in rural areas and have low educational attainment. However, this paper observes a trend of increasing proportions of teenagers who are not poor, who have better education and are residents of urban areas, who have begun childbearing in their teens. Among the factors that could help explain this trend are the younger age at menarche, premarital sexual activity at a young age, the rise in cohabiting unions in this age group and the possible decrease in the stigma of out-of-wedlock pregnancy.</p><p>Key words: teenage pregnancy, early childbearing, age at menarche</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>Women’s age-specific fertility rates[*] follow a characteristic pattern. Soon after menarche, the fertility rate starts at a low level, peaks at ages 20-29, then declines until it stops completely following menopause. The optimal ages for successful pregnancy are in the peak reproductive years. At either end of the reproductive spectrum, that is at the youngest (below 20) and the oldest (40 and above) ages, there is a higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Studies have shown that at age 35 and over, and especially at 45 and over, women are more likely to experience gestational diabetes, placenta previa, breech presentation and operative vaginal delivery than younger women aged 20-29. Other observed complications that are more prevalent among older mothers compared to mothers in their twenties are preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, cesarean delivery, abruptio placenta and preterm delivery.1</p><p>Similarly, when the woman is at the younger extreme of the reproductive age spectrum, below 20 years, pregnancy carries the same elevated risk of adverse outcomes.2 Many studies consistently show that teenage mothers are at increased risk of pre-term delivery and low birth weight.3-6 From a large data base of births in the Latin American Center for Perinatology and Human Development in Uruguay, it was found that after adjusting for major confounding factors, women age 15 and younger were at increased risk for maternal death, early neonatal death and anemia compared with women age 20-24. Furthermore, women aged less than 20 had higher risk for postpartum hemorrhage, puerperal endometritis, operative vaginal delivery, low birth weight, pre-term delivery and small for gestational age infants.7 The same elevated risks for teenage pregnancies, independent of known major confounders like low socioeconomic status, inadequate prenatal care and inadequate weight gain during pregnancy were documented using data from the 1995-2000 nationally linked birth/infant death data set of the United States compiled by the National Center for Health Statistics and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.8 In developing countries where no large data bases exist, evidence from smaller samples show similar results indicating that the risks are not specifically linked to the level of development of a country’s health care system and the availability of appropriate maternal care for very young pregnant women,4 but are specific to the age group and its accompanying implication of biological immaturity for childbearing. The risks follow an age gradient; they are generally higher at the younger end of the teenage years and diminish toward the latter teen years.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            27. Teenage Pregnancy Essay (argumentative)​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Teenage Pregnancy Essay (argumentative)Teen pregnancy is a problem that has been a problem for a long time. It's a complicated problem with a lot of moving parts and serious repercussions for both the mother and the child. In spite of numerous efforts to reduce the number of teenage pregnancies, this issue persists in many nations. In this essay, I will argue that comprehensive sex education and access to contraception should be used to address teenage pregnancy more effectively.<p></p>Lack of access to comprehensive sex education is a major factor in teenage pregnancy. A lack of accurate information about sexual health among many teenagers can encourage risky behavior and poor decision-making. Schools should provide comprehensive sex education, including information on healthy relationships, sexually transmitted diseases, and contraception. Teenagers will be better able to make informed decisions about their sexual health if accurate and comprehensive information is provided to them.<p></p>Unintended pregnancies can occur when a large number of teenagers do not have access to or the financial means to purchase contraception. The number of teenage pregnancies can be significantly reduced by providing free or low-cost contraception. In addition, it is essential that contraceptive methods be easily accessible and widely available.<p></p>Teenage mothers require both emotional and financial support as well. Poverty, lack of education, and social isolation are just a few of the issues that young mothers frequently face. We can assist these mothers in overcoming these obstacles and give them the best chance to raise their children in a healthy and secure environment by providing them with emotional and financial support.<p></p>Teenage pregnancy is a serious problem that requires more effective intervention. We can help teens make educated decisions about their sexual health and reduce the number of teen pregnancies by providing comprehensive sex education and access to contraception. Teenage mothers require both emotional and financial support as well. When it comes to preventing teenage pregnancies and supporting and empowering young mothers, we should take a comprehensive approach.<p></p><br />

Having a baby means growing up and taking on many responsibilities, which many teens are not ready to do at such a young age. “The second you find out your having a baby, you have to grow up right then” - Nicole. Getting pregnant as a teen changes your whole life, your forced to grow up. The best thing teens can do is to wait and just enjoy being a kid while they still can be one. One day they will have to grow up, but it doesn’t have to so soon.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>T</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>g</strong><strong>e</strong><strong> </strong><strong>P</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>g</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>c</strong><strong>y</strong><strong> </strong><strong>I</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>;</strong></p><p></p><p>Teenage pregnancy is defined as occurring between thirteen and nineteen years of age. There are, however, girls as young as ten who are sexually active and occasionally become pregnant and give birth. The vast majority of teenage births in the United States occurs among girls between fifteen and nineteen years of age.</p><p><strong>ANSWERS</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p>Teenage Pregnancy Essay | Essay on Teenage Pregnancy for Students and Children</p><p></p><p>Teenage Pregnancy Essay: Teenage is a crucial growth phase in the life of any individual fraught with physiological changes and often, psychological conflicts. In this condition, finding oneself to be a pregnant teenager can come down as shocking and even traumatizing for the individual, as-well-as, for her family and friends.</p><p></p><p>Scientifically speaking, teenage pregnancy is the occurrence of pregnancy in females under the age of twenty. Sometimes, even pre-teen females can become pregnant, as reported in various instances. Teenage pregnancy is a matter of social stigma in most countries, and adolescent mothers are often met with socio-economic disadvantages and ostracization.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Teenage pregnancy is the occurrence of pregnancy in females under the age of twenty. Teenagers belong to the age group of thirteen to twenty, and while teenagers are not practically children, they aren’t adults either, and this phase of confusion puts them at a greater risk. As sexual development sets in, teenagers are hounded by curiosity to explore their bodies. Due to a lack of awareness regarding sex, they often engage in unsafe sex, eventually becoming teenage parents.</p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p>Mostly such pregnancies are unplanned, and minors are not ready to bear the responsibilities of being a parent. Globally, the rate of teenage pregnancy is relatively high. Most cases are reported from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Africa, whereas rates are comparatively lower in Asia. As per studies, it is seen that the quality of teenage pregnancy is higher in developing countries as compared to developed countries, and mostly rural areas report higher cases than urban areas. This shows that the socio-economic background of teenagers majorly contributes to teenage pregnancies. Mostly teenagers from lower backgrounds with little or no sex education end up with teenage pregnancies.</p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p>Another reason is a discussion regarding sex being a taboo. Often conservative parents and even teachers in schools don’t engage in sexual conversations. As a result, teenagers lack basic knowledge about sex or safe sexual practices. The lack of resources on sexual awareness leads teenagers to seek help from their peers that eventually leads them to have wrong notions about sex. Teenagers barely understand the issues regarding sexual intercourse and the use of contraceptives. A study in the United States reveals that about 53% of teenagers lack information regarding sexual intercourse and contraceptives. The glorification of sex in mainstream media is another reason why most teenagers lack the moral outlook that prevents them from engaging in irresponsible sexual activities—engaging in underage alcohol consumption and drug abuse is another contributing factor in teenage pregnancies. Often teenagers seeking social validation from their peers engage in drinking resulting in them losing their senses and eventually engaging in unsafe sex.</p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p>In developing countries, sexual abuse of underage girls from lower backgrounds majorly contributes to rising rates of teenage pregnancies. Hailing from low-income backgrounds, these girls are pushed into sex trafficking to support their families and are exploited by older men. In most developing countries, girls are married off eighteen, and such teenage pregnancies are not met with social and moral stigmatization.</p><p></p><p>Whereas in developed countries, most teenage pregnancies occur out of wedlock while the teenagers are still in school, leading to social ostracization and alienation of such adolescent mothers. They often have to drop out of school, and without a formal degree, they have to do low-income jobs to support their child. Such children hailing from underprivileged homes, often without a father, engage in criminal activities and drug abuse, thus add to social evils and poverty. In a nutshell, teenage pregnancies create a domino effect in society at large.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
