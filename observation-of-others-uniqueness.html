Heobserved burrs or plant seed-sacs clinging to hispants and to the fur of his dog. With a burningcuriosity, George ran to his microscope andinspected one of the many burrs. He saw all thesmall hooks that enabled the seed-bearing burrto cling so tightly to the tiny loops in the fabricof his pants.George de Mestral raised his head from themicroscope and smiled thinking, "Hmm, I willdesign a unique, two-sided fastener, one side withstiff hooks like the burr and the other side withsoft loops like the fabrics of my pants."What do you suppose his invention was?​</a>

                                            Accepting our Differences, Accepting Ourselves We are all different. This seems like an obvious statement, but it is often the obvious statements which require the most scrutiny and investigation, exactly because they are the ones we take least time to consider. 6 Even though we all share the essential experience of a human being, each of us filters this experience through our own personal characteristics and background, and above all through our consciousness, the mysterious element that gives us our sense of individuality and makes us unique and different from any other person on the planet. . • Each one of us lives, therefore, a fragment of the human experience. The reality of a president will be different than that of a miner, or a journalist, the experiences of a female will be different than that of a male, a poor person than a rich. But whoever we are, none of us experiences the full spectrum of human reality. Therefore, any world- view we may have is incomplete. It is partially based on truth, and partially on ignorance. B C If we humbly accept that our world-view is lacking, listen to other world views and observe other ways of life we may actually expand our understanding and construct a wider picture of reality. ctivity: What does it mean to have an authentic dialogue​</a>

                            10. Accepting our Differences, Accepting Ourselves We are all different. This seems like an obvious statement, but it is often the obvious statements which require the most scrutiny and investigation, exactly because they are the ones we take least time to consider. 6 Even though we all share the essential experience of a human being, each of us filters this experience through our own personal characteristics and background, and above all through our consciousness, the mysterious element that gives us our sense of individuality and makes us unique and different from any other person on the planet. . • Each one of us lives, therefore, a fragment of the human experience. The reality of a president will be different than that of a miner, or a journalist, the experiences of a female will be different than that of a male, a poor person than a rich. But whoever we are, none of us experiences the full spectrum of human reality. Therefore, any world- view we may have is incomplete. It is partially based on truth, and partially on ignorance. B C If we humbly accept that our world-view is lacking, listen to other world views and observe other ways of life we may actually expand our understanding and construct a wider picture of reality. ctivity: What does it mean to have an authentic dialogue​</h2><br />

                            12. 1. The Self has several distinctive characteristics that separate from other selves."2. The Self has its own experiences and emotions, which is very different and uniquein any other way.3. Self-Concept is a combination of both our actual-self (present) and ideal-self(future self).4. Self-Concept can also be our comparison to others, even our people who have adirect and indirect influence.5. Our observation of ourselves and others, the feedback from others, ourhistorical or cultural perspective also play a role in shaping our self-concept.6. Having self-knowledge in our aspects and historical beginnings also provideessential information shaping our actual self, which is very much closer or farfrom our ideal self.7. In the process of merging our actual self and ideal self, our social roles provideus the adjustment in the changing and conflicting development of our society.8. The actual and ideal self can't be confused in defining the "self". It must becollated and defined according to its aspects and its development and evenlapses, of the self is very unique in every individual in which they have uniquedefinition and expression.​</h2><br />
                        <p>Answer:</p><p>1. yes it's true our own "self" has unique characteristics different from other "selves" or should I say from others specifically.</p><p></p><p>2. All children and youth develop a sense of self through their life experiences, knowledge and environment. This lesson provides an introduction into what factors play a role in the development of a sense of self and how you can support children and youth.</p><p></p><p>3. Actual self” is the way in which a person sees himself now. It is who we actually are. It is how we think, how we feel, look, and act. “Ideal self” is the way in which a person would like to see himself. It is how we want to be. It is an idealized image that we have developed over time.</p><p></p><p>4. True, Because By comparing our attitudes to others, we see the uniqueness of our own skills and styles in life. Thus, self-concept is formed when we compare ourselves to people who directly and indirectly influence us.</p><p></p><p>5. We have already learned that other people influence our self-concept and self-esteem. While interactions we have with individuals and groups are definitely important to consider, we must also note the influence that larger, more systemic forces have on our self-perception. Social and family influences, culture, and the media all play a role in shaping who we think we are and how we feel about ourselves. Although these are powerful socializing forces, there are ways to maintain some control over our self-perception.</p><p></p><p>7. The social roles make us to learn the hypocritical tendency , as the society tends to be unfairly critical for the unknown or not preferred and supportive for the known or preferred . As commonly people agree - become a judge when others are variant from their ideal self and become a advocate when oneself is variant from the ideal self.</p><p></p><p>8. The real self can be seen by others, but because we have no way of truly knowing how others view us, the real self is our self-image. The ideal self, on the other hand, is how we want to be. It is an idealized image that we have developed over time, based on what we have learned and experienced.<br /></p><p>Explanation:</p><p>BRAINLYEVERYDAY </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>yes, our country is unique from food to culture. The Philippines is one of the countries that reach in culture, tradition, and food from exotic to non-exotic. this is one of the reasons also why a lot of people from other countries curious, want, and love the Philippines. On the other hand about the statement of DOT's I agree that the Philippines is one of the unique countries when it comes to eating exotic meat. Eating exotic meat is already in the blood line of Filipinos even before. Especially indigenous people, exotic food is their way to live longer or to feed their families. Moreover, in present day eating exotic food is still known and even the non-indigenous people already tried and taste it.</p><p></p><br />
