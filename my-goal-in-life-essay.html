                                            Hello, I will be sending parts of my essay for people to correct. Would want it to be perfect for my teacher to understand why they are so important to me.
All my life I have loved doing many things, but only a few amazing things have turned into big goals. That has made me the person I am today.
	One of these goals is in TKD. I have enjoyed doing TKD since I was in the kinder garden. I enjoy TKD because it has taught me honesty, integrity, perseverance, self-control, an indomitable spirit, and most importantly, confidence. The dojang has taught me self-defense, and I have stuck to it for many years. It is important to me because the people there have kept me going. Also, it is a fun sport to do. With all of this information, you can conclude that this sport is important to me. Since you probably understand now why I picked this sport. Even though I am very good and have my black belt, my journey will not stop there. I want to continue helping at the dojang, And go up in ranks. That is my current goal for TKD for now.</a>

                                            since the beginning of time, beauty standards have been defined and coveted. Every time standards change, the current generation’s perception of themselves does, too. For my generation, our butts aren’t big enough, our stomachs aren’t flat enough and our bodies aren’t curvy enough. For the generation before us, their hair wasn’t big enough or their butts flat enough. The common denominator is that these standards have a negative effect on those who are exposed to them. It especially affects teens and pre-teens, as they are just coming into who they are, and self-image is a large part of this. According to the Park Nicollet Melrose Center, 53 percent of thirteen-year-old American girls are unhappy with their bodies. The number increases to 78 percent by the time they reach 17.  A negative self-image can not only contribute to several mental illnesses and disorders, but problems that last a lifetime. It’s extremely hard to combat insecurity once you’ve dealt with it before. A 2010 study focused on girls ages 13 to 17 found nine out of 10 girls felt pressured by the media and fashion industries to be skinny. The media is a constant reminder of the narrow definition of what beauty has become. Places like Victoria’s Secret who denounce plus-size women who they don’t “market” to when they’re one of the biggest beauty stores in the world play a large part in this. You also have stores whose sizes run smaller than what is normal, bringing on insecure thoughts. The biggest problem is the media. Teens and pre-teens spend most of their time on social media, looking at these ridiculous body goals and looks. These images are doctored, airbrushed and usually heavily-edited. I have no problem with anyone who gets plastic surgery, but what about the girls who see those bodies and compare themselves? It’s unhealthy, at the very least. Subscribing to these images can only have a negative effect on these young women who are still growing into who they are, in a stage of their life already plagued with enough self-doubt. Magazines are not exempt from this problem. Magazines are largely digital these days, and they also utilize the various practices of editing the images they put out. In fact, magazines are the professionals at this. Magazine editors often lighten skin colors, take in hips and lengthen legs — the list goes on. American actress Zendaya was a victim of such manipulation in 2015. The singer called out Modeliste magazine for editing her body in images shot for the issue. The then 19-year-old wrote on Instagram, “Had a new shoot come out today and was shocked when I found my 19 year old hips and torso quite manipulated. These are the things that make women self conscious, that create the unrealistic ideals of beauty that we have.” The images are not without implications at all, and it’s irresponsible for those charged with creating the current images of beauty to keep putting them out. Why publish an image of someone who doesn’t even look like the image? It only helps to foster unhealthy thought processes, low self-esteem and problems for people growing up alongside them. make a reflection essay of that story​</a>

All my life I have loved doing many things, but only a few amazing things have turned into big goals that have made me the person I am today.
	One of these amazing goals is in TKD. I have enjoyed doing TKD since I was in the kinder garden. I enjoy TKD because it has taught me honesty, integrity, perseverance, self-control, an indomitable spirit, and most importantly confidence. The dojang has taught me self-defense obviously, and I have stuck to it for many years. It is important to me because the people there have kept me going. Also, it is a very fun sport to do. With all of this information, I think you can conclude that this sport is very important to me. Since you probably understand now why I picked this sport. Even though I am very good and have my black belt, my journey will not stop there. I want to continue helping at the dojang, And go up in ranks. That is my current goal for TKD for now.</a>

How is the crystal formed?2. Is it beneficial or harmful to man or both? Discuss how it is beneficial or harmful to man.3. If it is something harmful, what can be done to avoid its formation? If it is something beneficial, how can its formation be promoted? Note: Write your essay on a short bond paper. Cite your sources following the APA format. Choose the crystal from the given list below:a. Oxides of magnesium and calcium produced from hard waterb. Calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate in kidney stonesMY ANSWER(COPY IF YOU WANT)Emerald Synthetic emeralds are referred to as 'created emeralds' and have been produced by flux-growth or hydrothermal processes. In the flux-growth process, crystals are created by dissolving chromium, beryllium and other elements in a molten flux and allowing crystallization to occur on a seed of beryl. Emerald is truly one of the most therapeutic as well as beneficial gemstones that one can ever wear. It can be especially good for people who are finding it difficult to concentrate and focus their work.  The ancient saints and sages have described a lot about the emerald stone benefits, its metaphysical properties and strong healing powers.  They deeply believed that wearing a Panna stone benefits the individual by providing good health, wisdom, prosperity, creative skills and blissful marital life. Emerald is a gemstone and a variety of the mineral beryl (Be3Al2(SiO3)6) colored green by trace amounts of chromium or sometimes vanadium. Beryl has a hardness of 7.5–8 on the Mohs scale. Most emeralds are highly included, so their toughness (resistance to breakage) is classified as generally poor. The color of the gemstone is often used to indicate its authenticity. Hold your gem up to the light and analyze its color. Real emeralds will showcase a pure green or blue-green hue. Hence, if the stone you are holding displays yellow or brown undertones, it is most likely a fake.</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>When you earn a degree, you accomplish a big step. You gain knowledge, skills and experience to help you both in your career and in life in general. On top of that, by gaining additional skills in communication and problem solving and achieving your goals, you can also increase your confidence. </p><p>It helps a person to get knowledge and improve confidence level all through the life. It plays a great role in our career growth as well as in the personal growth. It has no limitation; people of any age group can get education anytime. It helps us to determine about good and bad things. Goals are crucial to school success (and areas of life beyond the classroom). Setting and tracking goals helps your child learn important life skills such as planning, organization, and time management while also building communication skills, self-awareness, and confidence.</p><p></p><p>Those who get an education have higher incomes, have more opportunities in their lives, and tend to be healthier.

There are always what you plan, and then there’s things that just happen that you would usually rather not have of. You can always make goals and things and hope that things go alright and end up close to what you expected. </p><p>I am currently eighteen years old. I am working on setting up all my financial things so that I am independent and can rely on myself for what I need and not have to worry about having my parents approving of things and being responsible for what I choose to do. I am going to take out a small loan soon and work on building up my credit history. I am also planning on transferring all my things like my car and phone to my name. This summer I…show more content…</p><p>I will then purchase my own house and also a car. I will be paying insurance on both of these items. I will work the rest of my life as a Nurse and will eventually retire at the age of 65.</p><p>Although I don’t really know how well all of this will work out and I’m sure there are probably easier ways to do all this, I don’t think I will be talking to any professionals. I think I have enough basic understanding in order to keep myself stable. Granted I will probably fall a couple of times and make a few mistakes, I’ve been taught to keep working at it and you’ll get it right eventually. I know that in order to get what you want you have to try and work really hard. I don’t believe in being handed things, whether it be money or advice or anything else. I would rather try and fail then have someone tell me what to and what not to do. </p><p> I myself believe in risks to an extent. I think they are alright as long as they are somewhat logical. I don’t believe in “jumping off a cliff with no ropes hoping to survive”. I plan on having two accounts, one checking and one savings. I will mainly work with my checking account and the savings will not be touched unless for emergencies. I will keep a minimum of a thousand dollars in my savings account, which I will be opening at a credit union since they have a slightly higher interest rate, so I will always have it. I have learned to always keep a “safe".</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            9. since the beginning of time, beauty standards have been defined and coveted. Every time standards change, the current generation’s perception of themselves does, too. For my generation, our butts aren’t big enough, our stomachs aren’t flat enough and our bodies aren’t curvy enough. For the generation before us, their hair wasn’t big enough or their butts flat enough. The common denominator is that these standards have a negative effect on those who are exposed to them. It especially affects teens and pre-teens, as they are just coming into who they are, and self-image is a large part of this. According to the Park Nicollet Melrose Center, 53 percent of thirteen-year-old American girls are unhappy with their bodies. The number increases to 78 percent by the time they reach 17.  A negative self-image can not only contribute to several mental illnesses and disorders, but problems that last a lifetime. It’s extremely hard to combat insecurity once you’ve dealt with it before. A 2010 study focused on girls ages 13 to 17 found nine out of 10 girls felt pressured by the media and fashion industries to be skinny. The media is a constant reminder of the narrow definition of what beauty has become. Places like Victoria’s Secret who denounce plus-size women who they don’t “market” to when they’re one of the biggest beauty stores in the world play a large part in this. You also have stores whose sizes run smaller than what is normal, bringing on insecure thoughts. The biggest problem is the media. Teens and pre-teens spend most of their time on social media, looking at these ridiculous body goals and looks. These images are doctored, airbrushed and usually heavily-edited. I have no problem with anyone who gets plastic surgery, but what about the girls who see those bodies and compare themselves? It’s unhealthy, at the very least. Subscribing to these images can only have a negative effect on these young women who are still growing into who they are, in a stage of their life already plagued with enough self-doubt. Magazines are not exempt from this problem. Magazines are largely digital these days, and they also utilize the various practices of editing the images they put out. In fact, magazines are the professionals at this. Magazine editors often lighten skin colors, take in hips and lengthen legs — the list goes on. American actress Zendaya was a victim of such manipulation in 2015. The singer called out Modeliste magazine for editing her body in images shot for the issue. The then 19-year-old wrote on Instagram, “Had a new shoot come out today and was shocked when I found my 19 year old hips and torso quite manipulated. These are the things that make women self conscious, that create the unrealistic ideals of beauty that we have.” The images are not without implications at all, and it’s irresponsible for those charged with creating the current images of beauty to keep putting them out. Why publish an image of someone who doesn’t even look like the image? It only helps to foster unhealthy thought processes, low self-esteem and problems for people growing up alongside them. make a reflection essay of that story​</h2><br />

All my life I have loved doing many things, but only a few amazing things have turned into big goals that have made me the person I am today.
	One of these amazing goals is in TKD. I have enjoyed doing TKD since I was in the kinder garden. I enjoy TKD because it has taught me honesty, integrity, perseverance, self-control, an indomitable spirit, and most importantly confidence. The dojang has taught me self-defense obviously, and I have stuck to it for many years. It is important to me because the people there have kept me going. Also, it is a very fun sport to do. With all of this information, I think you can conclude that this sport is very important to me. Since you probably understand now why I picked this sport. Even though I am very good and have my black belt, my journey will not stop there. I want to continue helping at the dojang, And go up in ranks. That is my current goal for TKD for now.</h2><br />

                            14. Performance Task: Goal: To write a four to six paragraph essay about a crystal of your choice by answering the following questions:1. How is the crystal formed?2. Is it beneficial or harmful to man or both? Discuss how it is beneficial or harmful to man.3. If it is something harmful, what can be done to avoid its formation? If it is something beneficial, how can its formation be promoted? Note: Write your essay on a short bond paper. Cite your sources following the APA format. Choose the crystal from the given list below:a. Oxides of magnesium and calcium produced from hard waterb. Calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate in kidney stonesMY ANSWER(COPY IF YOU WANT)Emerald Synthetic emeralds are referred to as 'created emeralds' and have been produced by flux-growth or hydrothermal processes. In the flux-growth process, crystals are created by dissolving chromium, beryllium and other elements in a molten flux and allowing crystallization to occur on a seed of beryl. Emerald is truly one of the most therapeutic as well as beneficial gemstones that one can ever wear. It can be especially good for people who are finding it difficult to concentrate and focus their work.  The ancient saints and sages have described a lot about the emerald stone benefits, its metaphysical properties and strong healing powers.  They deeply believed that wearing a Panna stone benefits the individual by providing good health, wisdom, prosperity, creative skills and blissful marital life. Emerald is a gemstone and a variety of the mineral beryl (Be3Al2(SiO3)6) colored green by trace amounts of chromium or sometimes vanadium. Beryl has a hardness of 7.5–8 on the Mohs scale. Most emeralds are highly included, so their toughness (resistance to breakage) is classified as generally poor. The color of the gemstone is often used to indicate its authenticity. Hold your gem up to the light and analyze its color. Real emeralds will showcase a pure green or blue-green hue. Hence, if the stone you are holding displays yellow or brown undertones, it is most likely a fake.</h2><br />
