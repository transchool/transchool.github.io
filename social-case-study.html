The applied social sciences allow us to understand the details of the different structural problems and how itchanges through time3. Disaster risks cannot be prevented and mitigated through the use of applied social science4. Social workers play vital roles in peace negotiations and resolution of political tensions and violence throughthe application of peace-building processes and conflict management mechanisms5. Examples of behavioral focus on self-development are improving the grooming skills and personal hygiene6.

Case studies are systematic and critical investigation of a situation that poses a problem and necessitatessuggested solutions, recommendations, and pathway to avoid related problems in future12. A case study analysis does not require you to investigate a problem, examine the alternative solutions13. Case studies are used by teachers to see how learners can apply received knowledge in daily situations14. The structure of a good case study can be fitted into a single universal outline or copied directly from asample case.your analysis is part of an introduction15. Summarizing the outcome​</a>
