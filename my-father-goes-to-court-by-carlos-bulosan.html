                            1. biographical analysis about Carlos bulosan "my father goes to court"​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>This story was narrated by a four-year old kid whose family lived in a small town on Luzon. The farm of his father was destroyed by a Natural Calamity, which is flood. That is the reason why they preferred to live in a new place. They had a rich man neighbor, his children rarely go outside. Their house so tall, where their family can watch the kid’s (narrator) house. The rich man’s servants were always cooking some delicious food, like fried chicken, ham, and bacon. The kid’s family inhaling the heavenly spirit of those foods.</p><p></p><p>The narrator’s family always bond outside the Sun and bathing in the river. They always had a good time and a contagious laugh, and some people join their bonding, while the rich man only watch them. As day past on, the rich man’s family had a problem. The children became thin, the wife had a cough like the rich man. There was an opposite effect in the narrator’s family, they became bright and healthy. Their sickness was not in the food, because their servants always frying something delicious to eat. After that, their house was always close, but the aroma of the food was still drifted by the wind.</p><p></p><p>One morning, a police man knocked on the door of the narrator’s house. The rich man had a complaint to them, because they were accused by stealing the spirit of the wealth and food.</p><p></p><p>When the trial came, the narrator’s family came first. After a few minutes, the rich man’s family came with a lawyer, their body was so thin and they look sick. The narrator’s father didn’t had any lawyer, he fight on his own. The trial starts, the lawyer questioned the narrator’s father. In the first question, the father didn’t agree that they stole the spirit of the wealth and the food. The father agreed in the second question, where he state that their family hung outside the rich man’s house and inhale the food. He also agreed that when the rich man’s family became sick, their family became strong and healthy.</p><p></p><p>The rich man’s children went in shyly. They are really thin and look like sick. When it is time for the rich man, the narrator’s father was the one who question him. The rich man agreed that while their family having fun, the rich man’s family became worse and sad and they also stole the spirit of their wealth. He also agreed that the narrator’s family stole the spirit of their food by hanging outside their windows while their servants cooking the food. The narrator’s father commit to pay the rich man, he took the straw hat and collect some centavo and silver coins around the courtroom. When the father is ready, he went to the rich man and shook the hat in front of the rich man. He asked the man if he heard the spirit of money, and the rich man agreed. In that case, the father told to the man that he had already paid. After that, the case was dismissed.</p><p></p><p>The judge told to the narrator’s father the story where his uncle died because of laughing. The judge like to hear narrator’s family laughing. The kid’s sisters started to laugh, and all of the people in the courtroom laughed and the judge’s laugh was the loudest of all.</p><p></p><p><strong>REVIEW</strong></p><p></p><p>Honestly, it was really a great story. I also join to their laughter at the end. It was really came from our Philippine Literature. I understand it more than other stories. Let us talk about the story, what can you say about the rich man? The reason why they look sick and pale is because they didn’t enjoy their life, look, he seldom make the children go outside. The other family, even though they are poor, they had a good bonding.</p><p></p><p>Carlos Bulosan was a really good author, not because he was a Filipino, but by his story. You can saw the Filipino skills to him, and Philippine Literature was really good.</p><p></p><p><strong>REFLECTION</strong></p><p></p><p>This story really gives you many lessons. First, don’t be afraid to the case that had been accused to you if you don’t have secrets. Second, just tell the truth. Third, you may not need a lawyer if you can fight by your own by just HONESTY. Fourth, don’t accused someone because you are more powerful than them and you are jealous to them. Lastly, just enjoy your life.</p><p></p><p>Accusing your fault to someone was really a bad thing to do, don’t ever do that. Here in Philippines, if you always laugh and laugh, it will makes your life even longer. I can relate some story in this one, rich family had everything but they don’t have the spirit of love in each other. In poor family they didn’t had thigs like the rich man but you can see the love in them.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>yan po sagot ko nagpakahirap ko pong sagutin yan sana naman po may brainliest yang sagot ko</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Selection, the act of choosing something over other options, can be influenced by a variety of factors including culture, history, and environment. These factors can shape an individual's beliefs, values, and preferences, ultimately influencing their decision-making process. For instance, cultural beliefs and values can play a significant role in shaping an individual's choices, especially in societies where traditions are highly valued. Historical events, such as wars or political movements, can also impact an individual's decision-making by shaping their perceptions and experiences. The environment in which an individual lives can also influence their choices, as access to resources, education, and social support can vary significantly depending on one's surroundings.</p><p></p><p>In the story "Father Goes to Court" by Carlos Bulosan, we see how cultural factors influence the selection of the characters. The story depicts a Filipino family living in a small village in the Philippines, where the father is known for his honesty and hard work. When a wealthy man accuses the father of stealing his chickens, the family decides to take the case to court. However, the family faces cultural challenges as they navigate the legal system, which is heavily influenced by Spanish and American colonialism. Despite the family's efforts to prove the father's innocence, they are ultimately unsuccessful, as the court favors the wealthy man. This example highlights how cultural and historical factors can impact an individual's ability to achieve justice and the influence of societal power dynamics on decision-making.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>KEEP ON LEARNING ^√^</p><br />
