                                            Question: Can I get a long well explained University level essay that Analyze why Schopenhauer interprets life as amounting to suffering, and what he believes makes life more insufferable. Why does Schopenhauer think that suffering outweighs pleasure in life? Why does Schopenhauer reject God as a source of meaning in life? Why does he think that love is not capable of providing meaning either? If life is as meaningless as he intimates, does he think that suicide is an appropriate choice? Why or why not? What advice does Schopenhauer offer in terms of trying to inhabit a world with such woes? What arguments could one use to challenge him? Where do you stand on Schopenhauer's views, and why? Be sure to use concrete example to illustrate your points. Required Texts E.D. Klemke and Steven M. Cahn (eds.). The Meaning of Life, 4th Edition (Oxford 2017). Please includes citation from this text in the essay. in the essay could you include quotes and evidence from the text book with the page number. it needs to be around 1500 words university level essay. the subject is Philosophy: The Meaning Of Life</a>

A better option might be to achieve one’s goals in life, since these would constitute a definite objective to strive for.</p><p></p><p>To achieve physical perfection for the admiration of others: This is vanity and not in keeping with the spirit of achieving something substantial.</p><p></p><p>To be able to devote oneself to what is loved most: In other words, doing what makes you happy.</p><p></p><p>To matter: to count, to stand for something, to have made some difference that you lived at all.</p><p></p><p>To leave the world a better place than you found it: This is not as difficult as it seems and can be accomplished by leaving behind children who become better than we were.</p><p></p><p>To strive for power and superiority: In life there will always be natural leaders, whose purpose will be to lead.</p><p></p><p>For others, the meaning of life is to strive for specific goals and ideals, such as one of the following:</p><p></p><p>To be pointed to as an example of what a human being should be</p><p>To be compassionate</p><p>To be creative and innovative</p><p>To be generous</p><p>To become the person you want to be</p><p>To challenge oppression</p><p>To chase and more importantly, to live ones dreams</p><p>To continually improve</p><p>To continue the bloodline</p><p>To contribute to the well-being and spirit of others</p><p>To create a reason to live</p><p>To create equality</p><p>To distribute wealth</p><p>To do good, to do the right thing</p><p>To do your best to leave every situation better than you found it</p><p>To ease or reduce the suffering of others</p><p>To face your fears and accept the lessons life offers you</p><p>To find happiness</p><p>To define and follow your destiny</p><p>To give more than you take</p><p>To know and master the world</p><p>To know and master nature</p><p>To live a long and fruitful life</p><p>To love, to feel, to enjoy the act of living</p><p>To resolve the imbalance of the mind by understanding the nature of reality</p><p>To seek beauty in all its forms</p><p>To seek wisdom and knowledge and learn as many things as possible in life</p><p>To take every chance to help others while on your journey</p><p>To treasure every enjoyable sensation one has</p><p></p><p></p><p>In the end, those people who continue to search for the meaning of life will never come alive. They are so busy searching they miss all the great things life has to offer.</p><p></p><p>For some, life or human existence has no real meaning or purpose because human existence occurred out of a random chance in nature, and anything that exists by chance has no intended purpose.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, a person should not ask others what the meaning of life is, but should look within, for therein lies your purpose.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

Scientific contributions focus primarily on describing related empirical facts about the universe, exploring the context and parameters concerning the "how" of life.</p><p></p><p></p><p>According to Frankl, "We can discover this meaning in life in three different ways: (1) by creating a work or doing a deed; (2) by experiencing something or encountering someone; and (3) by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering" and that "everything can be taken from a man. Frankl claims that one finds meaning in life through three ways. “If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering. Suffering is an eradicable part of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death, human life cannot be complete.” Life is an experience for you to try everything.</p><p></p><p></p><p> For you to do what you like, along with what you don't like.

</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Even if there were many consequences and trials you've faced, you would still forced yourself to face them to move on in life. You won't just stop there, you will fight. And in every trial you would faced, there is always something that you would learn. And through that learning, you will learn to grow more and accept challenges with confidence and chin up high. There's no need to  be afraid of life. Life must be the one to be afraid of you, because your the one who makes choices that will later turn to sweet or bitter effects.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>In facing life too, we must at all cost, learn to have fun along the way. Being serious about life is good too but too much of it, can lead you to unhappiness. Be positive and socialize with others, meet new people and learn new experiences. Life is never always sweet at us. There are always times that we wanted to give up but why do you think we never really completely have given up?
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>One thing's for sure. It's love. There's a saying that goes, Love doesn't make the world go around but makes the ride worthwhile. There's always someone out there who is always helping you and concern about you. Don't make her/him go away, yet cherish and treasure him/her. That feeling will always be within you, no matter where you are. Love is really a great thing to experience while we are still alive and well yet we don't need to rush in order to find love. Let love find us instead. True happiness will eventually follow next after that. So don't give up on life, counter it and show life that there are plenty of reasons for you to smile</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Answer:</p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p>Arthur Schopenhauer, a 19th century German philosopher, interprets life as amounting to suffering in his work "The World as Will and Representation." He argues that the fundamental aspect of existence is not the rational, conscious self, but rather the underlying will to live, which he refers to as the "will to exist." This will is the source of all suffering, as it drives individuals to constantly seek pleasure and avoid pain, leading to a never-ending cycle of desire and disappointment.</p><p></p><p>Schopenhauer believes that the will to exist makes life more insufferable by constantly creating new desires and needs that can never truly be satisfied, resulting in a state of constant dissatisfaction. He states, "Desire is never satisfied by the satisfaction of a desire; indeed, the satisfaction of one desire is but the beginning of another" (Klemke and Cahn, 2017, p.88). He also believes that suffering outweighs pleasure in life because suffering is more intense and longer-lasting than pleasure.</p><p></p><p>Schopenhauer rejects God as a source of meaning in life because he argues that the concept of God only serves to perpetuate the cycle of suffering caused by the will to exist. He states, "If God were to grant us all our desires and needs, we would only desire for more and greater things" (Klemke and Cahn, 2017, p.89). He also argues that love is not capable of providing meaning because it is ultimately driven by the will to exist and therefore leads to suffering.</p><p></p><p>Despite his assertion that life is meaningless, Schopenhauer does not advocate for suicide as an appropriate choice. Instead, he advises individuals to detach themselves from their desires and needs in order to find peace and contentment. He suggests that individuals should focus on cultivating a sense of detachment and detachment from the will to exist, which he believes can lead to a state of contentment and tranquility.</p><p></p><p>However, one could argue that Schopenhauer's views are overly pessimistic and fail to take into account the positive aspects of life such as love, joy, and compassion. Additionally, his emphasis on detachment and denial of desires can be seen as a rejection of human nature and a failure to fully engage with the world.</p><p></p><p>Personally, while I acknowledge the validity of Schopenhauer's argument that suffering is an inherent part of the human experience, I believe that it is important to also recognize and appreciate the positive aspects of life. Therefore, I do not fully agree with his views.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, Schopenhauer's interpretation of life as amounting to suffering is rooted in his belief that the fundamental aspect of existence is the will to live, which drives individuals to constantly seek pleasure and avoid pain, leading to a never-ending cycle of desire and disappointment. He rejects God and love as sources of meaning in life and instead advises individuals to detach themselves from their desires and needs in order to find peace and contentment. However, his views have been criticized for being overly pessimistic and for rejecting human nature.</p><br />

What is the meaning of life?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Answer: It has been a month and 2 days since Baguio City declared an Enhanced Community Quarantine as part of the effort to combat the spread of COVID19. Like every other place, each household was assigned a quarantined pass, and we had to follow the assigned market days for our barangay. The kids and adults in the house are going stir crazy, so we try and find ways to occupy ourselves during this crisis.</p><p></p><p></p><p>My anger at the whole situation died down after getting more information from reliable sources like the Department of Health, the World Health Organization, and news outlets. I saw how grave the situation was and realized that I was being selfish.</p><p></p><p></p><p>This anger however was replaced by something else – a sense of foreboding, that the worst was yet to come. Coupled by a fear of the uncertain, and whether we will come out of this crisis anytime soon if at all.</p><p></p><p></p><p>After much contemplation, let me share some of the personal realizations I have about these challenging times that have helped me make it through every single day.</p><p></p><p></p><p>1. Be kind to yourself first. Since I was part of the Connected Women remote team, I was fortunate that work continued despite the lockdown. The major change for me was having the whole family at home with me, especially the kids. My daily schedule during the first week was all over the place, because I was juggling work with preparing meals and childcare and other things brought on by a full house.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I was kicking myself for not being quick enough with my work tasks, and for small things like cooking lunch late or not being able to put my toddler to bed early enough. Before the end of the first week, I realized that I was being too hard on myself. And this realization came after we did a check-in with our People and Operations team. From then on, I started telling myself: This is not business as usual. This is business unusual. It was normal to find oneself staring blankly into space and unable to think about anything else. What was important was to acknowledge this and to find a way to cope.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Regular check-ins on each team member helped me through this phase. Flexible work arrangements that considered your domestic situation (i.e. childcare, homeschooling, food runs, and errands) were also a Godsend. Since I had a better handle on my work schedule, I was able to tackle my domestic commitments better.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><strong>MArk</strong><strong> </strong><strong>me</strong><strong> </strong><strong>as</strong><strong> brainliest</strong><strong> </strong><strong>plss</strong><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>We all want to know the true meaning of life. But is there a meaning? What does life mean?</p><p>What is life? Life is the time we are alive on Earth, between birth and death. We all have a life. Birth is the beginning of life and death is the end.</p><p></p><p>There are many different interpretations of what the true meaning of life is. But also, there are different views on what it means to be alive. However, we can say that life means to live on and survive in order to pass on knowledge and shape the world for future generations. We all have a purpose in this world but we often don't know what that purpose is until later in our lives. Although we may not understand the purpose of our own lives, we still have control over how we live and what choices to make.</p><p>The true meaning of life is to live! Life is a gift that we give to the world. It is living for others. Life is not the time we are alive on earth, but it's what we do with our time. As I said before, life is a journey. It is the adventure of our lifetime, but it's not easy. We have ups and downs in life like everyone else, but that's all part of being alive. If life were easy, it wouldn't be as much fun.</p><p>I believe we are all born with a purpose. Our purpose is to live and to help each other live better. When people think about the true meaning of life I believe they are thinking about how to get a better life for them and their loved ones. If we learn from others' lessons then we can make a better future for ourselves. </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>means Religion means that you are faithful to what you believe in.
