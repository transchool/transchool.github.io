27. When the cold air sinks, it results to a high-pressure area. Since most of the air is pressing down, the air on the surface becomes dry. Formation of a high pressure area indicates fair weather; fewer clouds are found on the sky. As the air continuously rises, it will eventually cool, condense and form clouds. The formation of a low-pressure area indicates the possibility of rain. There is a higher chance of rain when more clouds are formed. An LPA can result to weather disturbances. Rains and strong winds are brought about by low pressure system *

Read the lines carefully and use your imagination as you move from one line to another. Answer briefly the questions that tells about how the gamer uses his body The Virtual Gamer by: Von RJ Josol I play the game from morning 'til night Never miss the chance to win the fight For I am destined to withstand the game I aim for victory and fame! I skip my meals and liquids, while I fight No breakfast, lunch, nor dinner at night: Eating was a burden, I tell my mind Cause a virtual gamer will never mind Then suddenly! On a clear daylight I felt something, I did not delight My hands are trembling, and little tummy burning! A crushing headache is very frightening My vision gets dimmer, A body thinner, weaker and cooler Help! Body organs are failing! I must do something or else I'll lose everything. I learned a lesson that every gamer must keep Inside your body are busy organs, even when you're asleep United in their functions, they work together as one Nourish your body organs and you will be a tough one Love your body, for you only have one; Be better, stronger, and smarter than ever. Because you can never win your battle, if your body is gone. For a virtual gamer checks his facts more than ever. Question How will your body react if you do not eat food and drink water in a day? 10​</a>

SUMMARIZING KEY INFORAMATION FROM A TEXT (for 20 PTS) DIRECTIONS: Rad the story below then write a summary of the paragraphs on the answer lines that follow THE TINY FROG Once upon a time, there was a group of tiny frogs who arranged a competition. The goal was to reach the top of a tower A huge crowd of frogs gathered to watch the race. The race began Not one frog in the audience believed that the contestants would reach to the top. After all, it was a HUGE lower The crowd grew and many yelled, This is too difficult "They will NEVER make it to the top." "Not a chance that they will succeed. The tower is too high!" One by one, the tiny frogs collapsed and fell off the tower. Still, there was a group of determined frogs that climbed higher and higher. But the crowd continued to yell , "This is too difficult. No one will make it!" Discouraged and convinced by the negative cries, more of these tiny frogs collapsed and fell off the tower Many frogs who were still climbing complained of the pain and eventually gave up. Some frogs, tired and battered, heard their peers' complaints and subsequently threw in the towel too. In the midst of this, one tiny frog persisted. He climbed, and he climbed. This tiny frog seemed to have super- frog strength the allowed him to push forward in spite of others failing. Why, though? Why is he able to climb so far when others are failing? the crowd wondered. By now, all the tiny frogs had either collapsed or given up except for that one tiny frog. The crowd continued to yel now at the tiny frog: "This is too difficult You will NEVER make it to the top!" "Mola chance that you will succeed. The tower is too high!" But for some reason that tiny frog climbed further, seemingly unaffected. Finally, he reached the top of the hill. He had reached his destination!​</a>

27. When the cold air sinks, it results to a high-pressure area. Since most of the air is pressing down, the air on the surface becomes dry. Formation of a high pressure area indicates fair weather; fewer clouds are found on the sky. As the air continuously rises, it will eventually cool, condense and form clouds. The formation of a low-pressure area indicates the possibility of rain. There is a higher chance of rain when more clouds are formed. An LPA can result to weather disturbances. Rains and strong winds are brought about by low pressure system *

                            12. What's New Below is a simple poem about the life of a virtual gamer. Read the lines carefully and use your imagination as you move from one line to another. Answer briefly the questions that tells about how the gamer uses his body The Virtual Gamer by: Von RJ Josol I play the game from morning 'til night Never miss the chance to win the fight For I am destined to withstand the game I aim for victory and fame! I skip my meals and liquids, while I fight No breakfast, lunch, nor dinner at night: Eating was a burden, I tell my mind Cause a virtual gamer will never mind Then suddenly! On a clear daylight I felt something, I did not delight My hands are trembling, and little tummy burning! A crushing headache is very frightening My vision gets dimmer, A body thinner, weaker and cooler Help! Body organs are failing! I must do something or else I'll lose everything. I learned a lesson that every gamer must keep Inside your body are busy organs, even when you're asleep United in their functions, they work together as one Nourish your body organs and you will be a tough one Love your body, for you only have one; Be better, stronger, and smarter than ever. Because you can never win your battle, if your body is gone. For a virtual gamer checks his facts more than ever.

SUMMARIZING KEY INFORAMATION FROM A TEXT (for 20 PTS) DIRECTIONS: Rad the story below then write a summary of the paragraphs on the answer lines that follow THE TINY FROG Once upon a time, there was a group of tiny frogs who arranged a competition. The goal was to reach the top of a tower A huge crowd of frogs gathered to watch the race. The race began Not one frog in the audience believed that the contestants would reach to the top. After all, it was a HUGE lower The crowd grew and many yelled, This is too difficult "They will NEVER make it to the top." "Not a chance that they will succeed. The tower is too high!" One by one, the tiny frogs collapsed and fell off the tower. Still, there was a group of determined frogs that climbed higher and higher. But the crowd continued to yell , "This is too difficult. No one will make it!" Discouraged and convinced by the negative cries, more of these tiny frogs collapsed and fell off the tower Many frogs who were still climbing complained of the pain and eventually gave up. Some frogs, tired and battered, heard their peers' complaints and subsequently threw in the towel too. In the midst of this, one tiny frog persisted. He climbed, and he climbed. This tiny frog seemed to have super- frog strength the allowed him to push forward in spite of others failing. Why, though? Why is he able to climb so far when others are failing? the crowd wondered. By now, all the tiny frogs had either collapsed or given up except for that one tiny frog. The crowd continued to yel now at the tiny frog: "This is too difficult You will NEVER make it to the top!" "Mola chance that you will succeed. The tower is too high!" But for some reason that tiny frog climbed further, seemingly unaffected. Finally, he reached the top of the hill. He had reached his destination!​</h2><br />
