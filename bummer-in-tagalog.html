                                            The inference is when you use the evidence provided in the text to draw a conclusion.
Directions: Read the passages and answer the questions that follow.
A. Mom arrived home to see a large hole in a glass window upstairs. She went inside and climbed to the second floor. She discovered a baseball on the floor, surrounded by glass. She could hear cheering coming from the Wilson’s backyard—two doors down. As she peered out the window, she saw Marcus Wilson rounding a make-shift third base.
1. What can you infer about the hole in the window? Provide at least one detail from the text to support your answer. 
B. Matt was finishing up the last few bites of his snack when his mom got home from work. She asked how his day was, and then she said, “Get your homework finished quickly because we have been invited to Aunt Sarah’s house for dinner. I told her I would bring the rest of the cake that we did not eat on Sunday.” Matt’s eyes widened, and he looked at the empty snack plate before him.
2. What can you infer about the snack that Matt just ate? Provide at least one detail from the text to support your answer. 
C. Marissa had never really liked football, but her friends all wanted to go to the game. So, she reluctantly told Taylor over the phone that she would go. Marissa was putting on jeans and a sweatshirt when her Dad called out, “Hey, ‘Rissa, one of your favorite movies is coming on tonight!” Bummer, thought Marissa, as she put on her shoes. Just then, she heard a crack of thunder and the pitter patter of raindrops. With her shoe still in her hand, she redialed Taylor’s number.
3. What do you infer that Marissa will say to Taylor when she answers the phone? Provide at least one detail from the text to support your answer.

                                            Below is an example of a Feature Article. Read, understand, then answer the questions Welcome to the now normal By: Ar. Vittoria Mawis-AlistoWhen the fight against COVID-19 started a year ago, many businesses and activities had to stop operations to contain the spread of the virus. Back then, a lot of us saw the event as a temporary inconvenience.     A year later, however, the war against the deadly disease continues. It has become evident that curbing the pandemic is taking longer than expected. When the fight against COVID-19 started a year ago, many businesses and activities had to stop operations to contain the spread of the virus. Back then, a lot of us saw the event as a temporary inconvenience.     A new term has been coined to describe our current situation of unpredictability—the “now normal.” This is a period when we live day to day, not knowing what to expect tomorrow. While the uncertainty might scare us, it is also an opportunity for us to improve our lives for the better.    When it comes to real estate, the now normal has definitely seen changes. Developers have come up with innovative ways to keep businesses running and units selling. Here are some revolutionary ideas in the now normal that show us that despite today’s challenges, we can still pursue our dream properties. When it comes to multi-family dwellings, contactless technologies have become prized assets. Many developers added smart home features in their condominium projects to lessen the need for touching objects and consequently the chance of transmitting pathogens. Open spaces, green features and daylighting solutions have also been highlighted in upcoming projects. These elements are thought to promote health and wellness, deemed as prized elements in the pandemic era.     Nowadays, it pays to be a techie. From Zoom conferences to video walkthroughs, various technological advancements enable us to connect with people without having to leave our homes. In the world of real estate, online presentations, digital walkthroughs and virtual consultations have become the norm. Webinars and recorded presentations teach us new things, from decorating our homes to creating virus-free, domestic spaces. These strategies have actually improved our means of communication with agents and developers. Compared to pre-pandemic times, we can say that the world of real estate has become more interconnected and accessible today.    The now normal challenges developers to implement radical solutions to solve unprecedented problems. While it is certainly a bummer that the COVID-19 pandemic remains present in our midst, this misfortune has enabled us to re-examine our priorities and make some changes. The real estate industry, in particular, has seen numerous improvements in its services and offerings. Despite the challenges, the now normal has certainly pushed us to aim for a better future. While it may take some time before we can fully resume our regular lifestyles, the changes that we’ve seen in this era certainly improve our way of living. Let us hope that with these innovations, we will be able to finally overcome the spread of the COVID-19 disease.*What kind of feature story do you think is “Welcome to the now normal”?

                                            Below is an example of a Feature Article. Read, understand, then answer the questions Welcome to the now normal By: Ar. Vittoria Mawis-AlistoWhen the fight against COVID-19 started a year ago, many businesses and activities had to stop operations to contain the spread of the virus. Back then, a lot of us saw the event as a temporary inconvenience. A year later, however, the war against the deadly disease continues. It has become evident that curbing the pandemic is taking longer than expected. When the fight against COVID-19 started a year ago, many businesses and activities had to stop operations to contain the spread of the virus. Back then, a lot of us saw the event as a temporary inconvenience. A new term has been coined to describe our current situation of unpredictability—the “now normal.” This is a period when we live day to day, not knowing what to expect tomorrow. While the uncertainty might scare us, it is also an opportunity for us to improve our lives for the better.When it comes to real estate, the now normal has definitely seen changes. Developers have come up with innovative ways to keep businesses running and units selling. Here are some revolutionary ideas in the now normal that show us that despite today’s challenges, we can still pursue our dream properties. When it comes to multi-family dwellings, contactless technologies have become prized assets. Many developers added smart home features in their condominium projects to lessen the need for touching objects and consequently the chance of transmitting pathogens. Open spaces, green features and daylighting solutions have also been highlighted in upcoming projects. These elements are thought to promote health and wellness, deemed as prized elements in the pandemic era. Nowadays, it pays to be a techie. From Zoom conferences to video walkthroughs, various technological advancements enable us to connect with people without having to leave our homes. In the world of real estate, online presentations, digital walkthroughs and virtual consultations have become the norm. Webinars and recorded presentations teach us new things, from decorating our homes to creating virus-free, domestic spaces. These strategies have actually improved our means of communication with agents and developers. Compared to pre-pandemic times, we can say that the world of real estate has become more interconnected and accessible today.The now normal challenges developers to implement radical solutions to solve unprecedented problems. While it is certainly a bummer that the COVID-19 pandemic remains present in our midst, this misfortune has enabled us to re-examine our priorities and make some changes. The real estate industry, in particular, has seen numerous improvements in its services and offerings. Despite the challenges, the now normal has certainly pushed us to aim for a better future. While it may take some time before we can fully resume our regular lifestyles, the changes that we’ve seen in this era certainly improve our way of living. Let us hope that with these innovations, we will be able to finally overcome the spread of the COVID-19 disease.*What kind of feature story do you think is “Welcome to the now normal”?

Directions: Read the passages and answer the questions that follow.
A. Mom arrived home to see a large hole in a glass window upstairs. She went inside and climbed to the second floor. She discovered a baseball on the floor, surrounded by glass. She could hear cheering coming from the Wilson’s backyard—two doors down. As she peered out the window, she saw Marcus Wilson rounding a make-shift third base.
1. What can you infer about the hole in the window? Provide at least one detail from the text to support your answer. 
B. Matt was finishing up the last few bites of his snack when his mom got home from work. She asked how his day was, and then she said, “Get your homework finished quickly because we have been invited to Aunt Sarah’s house for dinner. I told her I would bring the rest of the cake that we did not eat on Sunday.” Matt’s eyes widened, and he looked at the empty snack plate before him.

C. Marissa had never really liked football, but her friends all wanted to go to the game. So, she reluctantly told Taylor over the phone that she would go. Marissa was putting on jeans and a sweatshirt when her Dad called out, “Hey, ‘Rissa, one of your favorite movies is coming on tonight!” Bummer, thought Marissa, as she put on her shoes. Just then, she heard a crack of thunder and the pitter patter of raindrops. With her shoe still in her hand, she redialed Taylor’s number.

                            6. Below is an example of a Feature Article. Read, understand, then answer the questions Welcome to the now normal By: Ar. Vittoria Mawis-AlistoWhen the fight against COVID-19 started a year ago, many businesses and activities had to stop operations to contain the spread of the virus. Back then, a lot of us saw the event as a temporary inconvenience.     A year later, however, the war against the deadly disease continues. It has become evident that curbing the pandemic is taking longer than expected. When the fight against COVID-19 started a year ago, many businesses and activities had to stop operations to contain the spread of the virus. Back then, a lot of us saw the event as a temporary inconvenience.     A new term has been coined to describe our current situation of unpredictability—the “now normal.” This is a period when we live day to day, not knowing what to expect tomorrow. While the uncertainty might scare us, it is also an opportunity for us to improve our lives for the better.    When it comes to real estate, the now normal has definitely seen changes. Developers have come up with innovative ways to keep businesses running and units selling. Here are some revolutionary ideas in the now normal that show us that despite today’s challenges, we can still pursue our dream properties. When it comes to multi-family dwellings, contactless technologies have become prized assets. Many developers added smart home features in their condominium projects to lessen the need for touching objects and consequently the chance of transmitting pathogens. Open spaces, green features and daylighting solutions have also been highlighted in upcoming projects. These elements are thought to promote health and wellness, deemed as prized elements in the pandemic era.     Nowadays, it pays to be a techie. From Zoom conferences to video walkthroughs, various technological advancements enable us to connect with people without having to leave our homes. In the world of real estate, online presentations, digital walkthroughs and virtual consultations have become the norm. Webinars and recorded presentations teach us new things, from decorating our homes to creating virus-free, domestic spaces. These strategies have actually improved our means of communication with agents and developers. Compared to pre-pandemic times, we can say that the world of real estate has become more interconnected and accessible today.    The now normal challenges developers to implement radical solutions to solve unprecedented problems. While it is certainly a bummer that the COVID-19 pandemic remains present in our midst, this misfortune has enabled us to re-examine our priorities and make some changes. The real estate industry, in particular, has seen numerous improvements in its services and offerings. Despite the challenges, the now normal has certainly pushed us to aim for a better future. While it may take some time before we can fully resume our regular lifestyles, the changes that we’ve seen in this era certainly improve our way of living. Let us hope that with these innovations, we will be able to finally overcome the spread of the COVID-19 disease.*What kind of feature story do you think is “Welcome to the now normal”?

Many developers added smart home features in their condominium projects to lessen the need for touching objects and consequently the chance of transmitting pathogens. Open spaces, green features and daylighting solutions have also been highlighted in upcoming projects. These elements are thought to promote health and wellness, deemed as prized elements in the pandemic era. Nowadays, it pays to be a techie. From Zoom conferences to video walkthroughs, various technological advancements enable us to connect with people without having to leave our homes. In the world of real estate, online presentations, digital walkthroughs and virtual consultations have become the norm. Webinars and recorded presentations teach us new things, from decorating our homes to creating virus-free, domestic spaces. These strategies have actually improved our means of communication with agents and developers. Compared to pre-pandemic times, we can say that the world of real estate has become more interconnected and accessible today.The now normal challenges developers to implement radical solutions to solve unprecedented problems. While it is certainly a bummer that the COVID-19 pandemic remains present in our midst, this misfortune has enabled us to re-examine our priorities and make some changes. The real estate industry, in particular, has seen numerous improvements in its services and offerings. Despite the challenges, the now normal has certainly pushed us to aim for a better future. While it may take some time before we can fully resume our regular lifestyles, the changes that we’ve seen in this era certainly improve our way of living. Let us hope that with these innovations, we will be able to finally overcome the spread of the COVID-19 disease.*What kind of feature story do you think is “Welcome to the now normal”?
