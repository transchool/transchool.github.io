Validity comes from the word validy which means the extent to which the accuracy and accuracy of a measuring instrument (test) in carrying out its measuring function.  Means that <strong>validity</strong> is an instrument in which a study must be adjusted to the theory, method, or anything related to the elements of research so that it can be stated precisely.  Therefore validity must be tested properly so that it is adjusted to the research being carried out. A test can be said to have high validity if the test performs its measuring function or gives precise and accurate results according to the purpose of being subjected to the test.  A test that has incorrect results is said to have low validity.</p><p></p><p> The other side related to validity is accuracy.  A test that has high validity, in addition to carrying out its measuring <strong>function</strong> properly, also has high accuracy.  That is, accuracy in detecting small differences in the attributes it measures.  An example is in measuring motivation.  Of course, a <strong>researcher</strong> who makes this motivational instrument hopes that his research instrument can function properly to measure motivation.  The condition is that the instrument must have high validity.</p><p></p><p>Learn more about <strong>validity</strong> at https://brainly.ph/question/26294140.</p><p>#SPJ2</p><p></p><br />
