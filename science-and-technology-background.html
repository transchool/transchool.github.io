1. The footsteps were coming closer. I knew I had to get out of there fast. Looking desperately around, I finally spotted a small window at the end of the room, a beacon of light in the dark, rancid basement. I sprinted and leapt up to grab a ceiling pipe. Thankfully, the pipe was close enough to the window to allow me to swing my body through. My enemy was making his way down the hall, bursting open door after door. I needed to break through this window in two tries to make it out in time.

2. The year is 2020. You've just graduated from a highly-ranked virtual university. You had the opportunity to take e-learning classes from great professors and world leaders in government and business. It's cool to be smart—and even cooler to really understand technology. Almost all the good jobs today involve science, engineering, and technology. And there is such a demand for workers with your skills that you can choose from thousands of jobs. Many of these jobs have high starting salaries and perks like your own pet robot, a new convertible astromobile, or monthly online shopping allowances.

1. The footsteps were coming closer. I knew I had to get out of there fast. Looking desperately around, I finally spotted a small window at the end of the room, a beacon of light in the dark, rancid basement. I sprinted and leapt up to grab a ceiling pipe. Thankfully, the pipe was close enough to the window to allow me to swing my body through. My enemy was making his way down the hall, bursting open door after door. I needed to break through this window in two tries to make it out in time.

Indicate your thesis statement to guide you in making clear, focused and concise questions. Significance of the Study The findings of this study will underscore to the benefit of society considering that mathematics play an important role in science and technologies today. The greater demand for graduates with Mathematics background justifies the need for more effective, life changing teaching approaches. Thus, schools that apply the recommended approach derived from the results of this study will be able to train students better. Administrators will be guided on what should be emphasized by teachers in the school curriculum to improve students’ performance in Mathematics. For the researcher, the study will help them uncover critical areas in the educational process that many researchers were not able to explore. Thus, a new theory on learning mathematics may be arrived at.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Even before the colonization by the Spaniards in the Philippine islands, the natives of the archipelago already had practices linked to science and technology. Filipinos were already aware of the medicinal and therapeutic properties of plants and the methods of extracting medicine from herbs. They already had an alphabet, number system, a weighing and measuring system and a calendar. Filipinos were already engaged in farming, shipbuilding, mining and weaving. The Banaue Rice Terraces are among the sophisticated products of engineering by pre-Spanish era Filipinos.[2]</p><p></p><p>Spanish Colonial Period	</p><p>Edit</p><p>The colonization of the Philippines contributed to growth of science and technology in the archipelago. The Spanish introduced formal education and founded scientific institution. During the early years of Spanish rule in the Philippines. Parish schools were established where religion, reading, writing, arithmetic and music was taught. Sanitation and more advanced methods of agriculture was taught to the natives. Later the Spanish established colleges and universities in the archipelago including the University of Santo Tomas.[2]</p><p></p><p>The study of medicine in the Philippines was given priority in the Spanish era, especially in the later years. The Spanish also contributed to the field of engineering in the islands by constructing government buildings, churches, roads, bridges and forts.[2] Biology is given focus. Contributors to science in the archipelago during the 19th century were botanists, Fr. Ignacio Mercado., Dr. Trinidad Pardo de Tavera and Dr. Leon Ma Guerrero, chemist Anaclento del Rosario, and medicine scholars Dr. Manuel Guerrero, Dr, Jose Montes and Dr. Elrodario Mercado.[3]</p><p></p><p>The Galleon Trade have accounted in the Philippine colonial economy. Trade was given more focus by the Spaniard colonial authorities due to the prospects of big profits. Agriculture and industrial development on the other hand were relatively neglected.[3] The opening of the Suez Canal saw the influx of European visitors to the Spanish colony and some Filipinos were able to study in Europe who were probably influenced by the rapid development of scientific ideals brought by the Age of Enlightenment.[3]</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            18. Given the notes on writing research questions, formulate three (3) research questions from your research title on the previous lesson. Indicate your thesis statement to guide you in making clear, focused and concise questions. Significance of the Study The findings of this study will underscore to the benefit of society considering that mathematics play an important role in science and technologies today. The greater demand for graduates with Mathematics background justifies the need for more effective, life changing teaching approaches. Thus, schools that apply the recommended approach derived from the results of this study will be able to train students better. Administrators will be guided on what should be emphasized by teachers in the school curriculum to improve students’ performance in Mathematics. For the researcher, the study will help them uncover critical areas in the educational process that many researchers were not able to explore. Thus, a new theory on learning mathematics may be arrived at.

They are:</p><p><strong>• Economic purposes </strong>- maintaining a consistent supply of individuals with solid science and technology backgrounds in order to develop and sustain future prosperity for all.</p><p><strong>• Utilitarian purposes </strong>- ensuring that all members of society have the adequate scientific knowledge to participate effectively and critically in realms and activities where science can contribute to their personal well-being and quality of life.</p><p><strong>• Personal development purposes</strong> - ensuring that all people in society benefit from the ability to contribute that the analytical skills, investigative strategies, and values of science can make to their ability to learn, deal with day-to-day issues and problems successfully, and obtain satisfying employment.</p><p><strong>• Cultural purposes</strong> - ensuring that all members of society have a firm grasp of the history, evolution, and modern scope of science and scientific practice.</p><p><strong>• Democratic purposes</strong> - ensuring that all learners develop sufficient scientific knowledge, similarity with scientific language and argumentation, possibility and confidence in evaluating scientific reports, and media literacy in order to be active participants in the scientific and technological debate and decision-making.</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about the other education here:</strong></p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/29563325</strong></p><p><strong>#SPJ1</strong></p><br />
