Use the tree-structured theory as your reference. Do not forget to use your facial muscles and your hands!1. "Do not cry, Pepito, show these people that you are brave. It is an honor to die for one's country. Not everybody has that chance."- Jose Abad Santos Emotion: 2. "The obscenities of this country are not girls like you. It is the poverty which is obscene, and the criminal irresponsibility of the leaders who make this poverty a deadening reality. The obscenities in this country are the places of the rich, the new hotels made at the expense of the people, the hospitals where the poor die when they get sick because they don't have the money either for medicines or services. It is only in this light that the real definition of obscenity should be made."- F. Slonil José, Ermita A Filipino Novel Emotion: 3. "Sometimes it pays not to be interested in what happened but in what did not happen.'-Ambeth Ocampo, Rizal Without the Overcoat Emotion: 4. "Sometimes I can feel my bones straining under the weight of all the lives I'm not living."- Jonathan Safran Foer, Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close Emotion: 5. "It's discouraging to think how many people are shocked by honesty and how few by deceit."- Noël Coward, Blithe Spirit Emotion:​</a>

It is an honor to die for one's country. Not everybody has that chance."- Jose Abad Santos Emotion: 2. "The obscenities of this country are not girls like you. It is the poverty which is obscene, and the criminal irresponsibility of the leaders who make this poverty a deadening reality. The obscenities in this country are the places of the rich, the new hotels made at the expense of the people, the hospitals where the poor die when they get sick because they don't have the money either for medicines or services. It is only in this light that the real definition of obscenity should be made."- F. Slonil José, Ermita A Filipino Novel Emotion: 3. "Sometimes it pays not to be interested in what happened but in what did not happen.'-Ambeth Ocampo, Rizal Without the Overcoat Emotion: 4. "Sometimes I can feel my bones straining under the weight of all the lives I'm not living."- Jonathan Safran Foer, Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close Emotion: 5. "It's discouraging to think how many people are shocked by honesty and how few by deceit."- Noël Coward, Blithe Spirit Emotion:​</h2><br />
