                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>For me, the age gap doesn't matter when both of them are not minor. When you love each other nothing can bother both of you even though you're younger or older.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My partner and I have what is considered an age gap, myself being the younger partner. We’ve been together for a bit over a year. In that time, I’ve certainly copped an earful. Usually from strangers. It was hard at first.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>As someone who was just young and feeling the excitement of new love, it was pretty frustrating to hear these things. I felt it very important to defend myself and him, prove that we were compatible and our relationship viable. Eventually I decided I should be putting this passionate energy into our relationship rather than our image. That was certainly the right choice.</p><br />
