Reflection Have you remembered Ms. Gina Lopez, who has been our late DENR Secretary for just a short period of time? From June 30, 2016 to May 3, 2017, Ms. Gina showed enthusiasm in her job whom wasted no time in addressing environmental issues. She was an empowered environmental activist since then. Now, let us look unto one of the scenarios that she is concerned with and that was eventually able to pursue closure of some mining companies. If you happen to explore Caraga region, you can affirm its richness in minerals because of several small- and large-scale mining companies that are currently operating. The existence of such companies undeniably threatens the environment and even human health. There was a study conducted on the aquatic biodiversity of Lake Mainit, Southern Philippines. Results showed a decline in fish resources as compared to a previous study. The researchers believed for several reasons why there was a difference on the species composition overtime. One of those reasons is the degrading water quality because of mining and domestic activities (Uy et al., 2015). With regards to water quality, Ebol et al. (2020) evaluated the levels of heavy metals namely Cadmium, Lead, and Mercury from key aquatic fauna and sediments. They also believed that the lake is at risk from such contamination due to industrial, agricultural wastes, and mining endeavors. Basically, mine discharges pollute water streams leading to the lake and other bodies of water that thereby accumulates toxins over time which greatly affect the land and water ecosystem. Lake Mainit plays important role in the lives of people nearby. It brought abundance and diverse offerings to humans, serving as a source of their living and a source of products within and outside the region. The irresponsible activities today would surely affect tomorrow's lives. With Ms. Gina's utmost concern, she was strongly firm in dealing the issue right away. If the same situation will continue in which the mining operates without taking serious considerations to the local environment and residents, what do you think will be a great impact towards the young generations like you in the near future? Express your reflection in five to ten sentences. .​</a>

NGOs have been playing a vital role in the provision of humanitarian and medicalassistance where states have been unable to meet demand, and non-state actors have been vital in publichealth education and the development and provision of treatments (BOND 2020).According to the Global Tapestry of Alternatives (2020), the current crisis has provided the context for:"an increasing emergence and visibility of an immense variety of radical alternatives to th[e) dominant regime(which range from initiatives with a specific focus like sustainable and holistic agriculture, community ledwater/ energy/ food sovereignty, solidarity and sharing economies, worker control of production facilities,resource/knowledge commons, and inter-ethnic peace and harmony, to more holistic or roundedtransformations such as those being attempted by the Zapatista in Chiapas and the Kurds in Rojava."...(https://www.e-ir.info/2020/10/02/ngos-and-transnational -non-state-politics/)Processing Questions:1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>This article examines the relationships among resistance skills, refusal efficacy, decision-making skills, and substance use for a sample of Mexican and Mexican American 5th grade students who were attending public schools in Phoenix, Arizona. An analysis of self-report questionnaire data indicated that the likelihood that male students reported ever having used one or more substances increased as they reported a greater willingness to use passive decision-making (e.g., going along) and decreased as they reported greater refusal efficacy and a greater willingness to utilize active decision making (e.g., thoughtful processing). No significant relationships emerged between the 4 predictors and lifetime substance use among the girls. These findings support the role of social skills in substance use prevention, shed light on an understudied group, and suggest the importance of continuing to examine gender differences in skills-based interventions.</p><br />

Despite these problems, COVID-19 has also been perceived to have opened up opportunities for transnationalnon-state politics, especially given the numerous noted failures of both state and intergovernmental institutionsin addressing the pandemic. NGOs have been playing a vital role in the provision of humanitarian and medicalassistance where states have been unable to meet demand, and non-state actors have been vital in publichealth education and the development and provision of treatments (BOND 2020).According to the Global Tapestry of Alternatives (2020), the current crisis has provided the context for:"an increasing emergence and visibility of an immense variety of radical alternatives to th[e] dominant regime(which range from initiatives with a specific focus like sustainable and holistic agriculture, community ledwater/energy/ food sovereignty, solidarity and sharing economies, worker control of production facilities,resource/ knowledge commons, and inter-ethnic peace and harmony, to more holistic or roundedtransformations such as those being attempted by the Zapatista in Chiapas and the Kurds in Rojava."..(https://www.e-ir.info/2020/10/02/ngos-and-transnational -non-state-politics/)Processing Questions:1.

                            13. Note: Score has to be multiplied by 2. The same rubric will be applied in the reflection. Reflection Have you remembered Ms. Gina Lopez, who has been our late DENR Secretary for just a short period of time? From June 30, 2016 to May 3, 2017, Ms. Gina showed enthusiasm in her job whom wasted no time in addressing environmental issues. She was an empowered environmental activist since then. Now, let us look unto one of the scenarios that she is concerned with and that was eventually able to pursue closure of some mining companies. If you happen to explore Caraga region, you can affirm its richness in minerals because of several small- and large-scale mining companies that are currently operating. The existence of such companies undeniably threatens the environment and even human health. There was a study conducted on the aquatic biodiversity of Lake Mainit, Southern Philippines. Results showed a decline in fish resources as compared to a previous study. The researchers believed for several reasons why there was a difference on the species composition overtime. One of those reasons is the degrading water quality because of mining and domestic activities (Uy et al., 2015). With regards to water quality, Ebol et al. (2020) evaluated the levels of heavy metals namely Cadmium, Lead, and Mercury from key aquatic fauna and sediments. They also believed that the lake is at risk from such contamination due to industrial, agricultural wastes, and mining endeavors. Basically, mine discharges pollute water streams leading to the lake and other bodies of water that thereby accumulates toxins over time which greatly affect the land and water ecosystem. Lake Mainit plays important role in the lives of people nearby. It brought abundance and diverse offerings to humans, serving as a source of their living and a source of products within and outside the region. The irresponsible activities today would surely affect tomorrow's lives. With Ms. Gina's utmost concern, she was strongly firm in dealing the issue right away. If the same situation will continue in which the mining operates without taking serious considerations to the local environment and residents, what do you think will be a great impact towards the young generations like you in the near future? Express your reflection in five to ten sentences. .​</h2><br />

Incorporating natural light can provide physical and physiological benefits to students, teachers and administrators. Natural light is shown to benefit the health, concentration and even test scores of pupils. Lighting is an important consideration in effective classroom design.</p><p></p><p>A study by the Heschong Mahone Group discovered that students receiving high levels of natural light where achieving test scores up to 18% higher than students receiving minimal natural light.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately it is not always possible to incorporate completely natural light into an existing classroom due to architectural constraints. Alternative solutions such as Daylight Bulbs and Tubes can be implemented to recreate the sensation and benefits of natural lighting as accurately as possible.</p><p></p><p>Southlands High School dining room</p><p></p><p>Lighting Factors</p><p>A carefully balanced lighting system will take into account a number of factors, including illuminance, uniformity, glare, flicker and colour, in order to provide optimal learning conditions.</p><p></p><p>Illuminance refers to the average light level in an area. Low illuminance has been linked to slower reading, reduced concentration, poor posture and long term weakened vision. An excessive variation of illuminance can also be an issue – this has been shown to actually reduce visual performance, causing discomfort and hyperactivity. A level of uniformity needs to be achieved to avoid excessive contrast and distraction.</p><p></p><p>Glare occurs where a bright image or object that is not the one the pupil wants to see is perceived directly, or via reflected light. Although pupils will attempt to compensate, perhaps by squinting or turning their head, glare still interferes significantly with visual tasks and can result in headaches, eyestrain, reduced concentration and diminished productivity.</p><p></p><p>Flicker is produced by certain lighting equipment and can result in discomfort or irritation. At a more serious level, it can lead to visual disturbance – for example, making moving objects or machinery appear stationary. Flicker can also trigger epilepsy and exacerbate various other conditions.</p><p></p><p>Colour also plays a vital role in the learning environment and good colour rendering performance is essential for effective learning, allowing pupils to make accurate colour judgements.</p><p></p><p>Hopwood Hall College</p><p></p><p>Other Considerations</p><p>Although the primary concern in providing an effective lighting system for the classroom is to facilitate pupils and educators, learning establishments have other important considerations to keep in mind. Government targets to reduce carbon emissions mean that schools must factor in sustainability when purchasing new equipment.</p><p></p><p>With artificial lighting accounting for the greatest proportion of energy costs in schools, the energy efficiency of any lighting installation will be a primary concern. Good design, specification, management and controls can have a significant impact on limiting electricity consumption, saving energy and keeping running costs to a minimum.</p><p></p><p> </p><br />
