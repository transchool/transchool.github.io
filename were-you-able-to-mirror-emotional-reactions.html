                        <p><strong>Emotions </strong>are more profound level responses happening in the subcortical regions of the brain. We, humans, are entirely experiencing emotional reactions. It is interchangeable. We, humans, experience different emotions throughout our lives, and often we let other people see us in an emotion that we think they have to see. </p><p>We are used to hiding the emotions that we are experiencing because we are afraid to let people know that we are weak. When it comes to showing and sharing our feelings with others, we have stereotypes that are not really ideal. We should never forget being true to ourselves is an essential aspect of expressing our own identity.  Allowing our emotions and different emotional reaction sometimes helps to ease the burden. It helps us to identify the natural element of our personality. We are all facing different scenarios in life, but the only matter is how we deal with and face these struggles. Remind yourself to value the real identity you have and show your inner essence. </p><p></p><p><strong>#BrainlyEveryday</strong></p><p>Refer to this link for more information:</p><strong>Question</strong>: How do you manage your emotional reactions​?<p> https://brainly.ph/question/11016506</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>•<strong>Y</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>We </strong><strong>can </strong><strong>able </strong><strong>to </strong><strong>mirror </strong><strong>emotional </strong><strong>reactions </strong><strong>towards</strong><strong> </strong><strong>to </strong><strong>different</strong><strong> </strong><strong>scenarios,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>because </strong><strong>in </strong><strong>our </strong><strong>daily </strong><strong>life </strong><strong>it </strong><strong>is </strong><strong>very </strong><strong>important </strong><strong>to </strong><strong>face </strong><strong>it </strong><strong>and </strong><strong>also </strong><strong>to </strong><strong>manage </strong><strong>it,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>especially</strong><strong> </strong><strong>when </strong><strong>it </strong><strong>comes </strong><strong>to </strong><strong>personalities,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>and </strong><strong>of course </strong><strong>us </strong><strong>people </strong><strong>know </strong><strong>and </strong><strong>how </strong><strong>to </strong><strong>face </strong><strong>it </strong><strong>because </strong><strong>it's </strong><strong>also </strong><strong>part </strong><strong>of </strong><strong>our </strong><strong>existence</strong><strong> </strong><strong>and </strong><strong>behaviour.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>I </strong><strong>HOPE </strong><strong>U </strong><strong>DONT </strong><strong>DELETE </strong><strong>MY </strong><strong>ANSWER </strong><strong>@</strong><strong>BLT07</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>HOPE </strong><strong>IT </strong><strong>HELPS </strong><strong>U </strong><strong>GOODLUCK&lt;</strong><strong>3</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>#</strong><strong>C</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>Y</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>G</strong></p><p><strong>#</strong><strong>B</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>Y</strong></p><p></p><br />

This is because the rays of light which are emitted from the letters strike the mirror and in this process they get inverted. These inverted rays enter our eyes and we see the inverted images of the letters.<p>2. Can you determine the time on the clock facing the mirror?</p>In some circumstances, yes it is possible.<p>3.

                        1. The following parts of myself:a) Your Facial Structure<p>Because I have <strong>self-acceptance</strong>, which is a virtue, I am happy and satisfied with the way my face looks and how it is built. Self-acceptance has helped me like myself, and all of the features on my face fit me well and make me look good. Self-acceptance being a virtue has made me realize that my face is fine as it is, and I don't need to add or take away anything to make it look better or worse. I'm happy with what I see in the mirror. The shape of my face that I see in the mirror is how I see myself, and I'm happy with it because I'm self-accepting, which is a good trait that helps me like my face the way it is.</p><p></p>b) The group of people you know<p>I'm glad to have friends like them and thankful for them. I can count on them when I need <strong>help</strong>, and they can give me the motivation and ideas I need to move forward. Even though they are not my blood, I consider them my family. Getting them was one of the best things I've ever done in my life.</p><p></p>c) My current academic performance<p>I'm neither happy nor sad about it because I know I'm not as good as everyone else, but that's fine with me and my family. What matters most to them is that I pass and graduate on time.</p><p></p>d) Living with family<p>I like living with my family because not everyone has one. No family is perfect, but I like making memories with them.</p><p></p>e) Relationship with God<p>I'm not religious, but I do believe in God. Even though I don't believe in God, I'm thankful because he keeps me safe, guides me every day, and gives me unexpected gifts.</p><p></p>f) Your current relationship status<p>I'm not in a relationship and I'm not in love, but I'm happy to be single and spend time with my family and friends. They made me feel like I was special, complete and loved.</p><p></p>g) Your body posture<p>I'm fine with my body posture, even though I don't have the same beautiful and ideal body as others. I love myself for who and what I am.</p><p></p>h) How I deal with problems in life<p>I stay strong and positive because life must go on, and even when we face problems and difficulties, we have to accept them and move on, no matter what.</p><p></p>2. How my feelings affect:<p>I can say that I'm happy with my life because I've thought about it. I've learned to be happy with what I have. I'm happy with how I look, how well I do in school, how my relationships are going right now, and how I stand. I don't let my fears and worries take over my life or have a place in it. I'm glad I have my family and friends with me because they helped me feel like I wasn't alone in life. Because of them, I'm okay with not having a special someone. For now, my relationships with God, my family, and my friends are enough. I surround myself with good things and stay strong when hard things happen.</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about grateful here: https://brainly.ph/question/6884434#</strong></p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Long version;</p><p>YES, we can able to mirror emotional reactions to a different scenarios of your personality when one person feels something that they don't know what kind of emotional it is or personality that's the time we will face our true identity.</p><p></p><p>Often, they are able to shift their attention from seeing their imperfections to seeing themselves as the sufferer and the creator of the suffering in the mirror. Something clicks. Usually, by the end of the session, their faces soften and over time they seem calmer and more self-accepting, kinder to themselves and more trusting of their own experience.</p><p></p><p></p><p>And the mirror revealed just how much their criticisms were affecting them because they could see it on their face.</p><p></p><p>First, they became aware of just how much they criticized themselves — whether it was their appearance or some other aspect of themselves that they habitually found unacceptable. The mirror brought it to light. And the mirror revealed just how much their criticisms were affecting them because they could see it on their face! Then they had a choice, and a practice, to treat themselves with more acceptance and compassion.</p><p></p><p>The mirror also reflected their facial expressions so they were much more aware of how they were feeling moment-to-moment which at first was a bit shocking for many. Some became more aware of emotions they typically avoided like fear, anger, or disgust, that they hadn’t noticed before. They found that their capacity to feel and accept a broader range of emotions increased from doing the meditation</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Short version;</p><p>Yes, in the morror at first you see how imperfect you are, how they are suffering, and as the creatpr of their own suffering.

                            29. were you able to mirror emotional reactions you had towards the different scenarious in your life and aspects of your personality​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Emotions are more profound level responses happening in the subcortical regions of the brain. We, humans, are entirely experiencing emotional reactions. It is interchangeable. We, humans, experience different emotions throughout our lives, and often we let other people see us in an emotion that we think they have to see.</p><p></p><p>We are used to hiding the emotions that we are experiencing because we are afraid to let people know that we are weak. When it comes to showing and sharing our feelings with others, we have stereotypes that are not really ideal. We should never forget being true to ourselves is an essential aspect of expressing our own identity.  Allowing our emotions and different emotional reaction sometimes helps to ease the burden. It helps us to identify the natural element of our personality. We are all facing different scenarios in life, but the only matter is how we deal with and face these struggles. Remind yourself to value the real identity you have and show your inner essence.</p><p></p><p>#BrainlyEveryday</p><p></p><p>Refer to this link for more information:</p><p></p><p>Question: How do you manage your emotional reactions?</p><p>brainly.ph/question/11016506</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>yan po</p><br />
