<p>
</p>The answer is letter B.  
PHOTOGRAPHY AS COMMUNICATION
Imagery (mostly photography) has become such an important part of modern communication. A photograph can be invaluable in books, journals, commercials, and so on. Or on the website, where users expect quick-loading pages with web-optimized images. You push the shutter and you want to share the best aspects of your environment with others from your point of view. If you take the shot with contact in mind, the snapshot would have communication value.
<p>
</p><p><strong>LANDSCAPE POETRY</strong>
</p>Using photography to convey a scene or an object is similar to using writing to communicate. It makes more sense if there is some kind of structure. If we make a word jumble, we will take a sentence... Sorry, but if we jumble the words in a statement, the contents remain the same, but the context is lost. A author, on the other hand, may organize words to elicit emotions and thoughts outside of the sentence. In a visual context, a photographer would organize the subjects/objects in a scene so that they make sense, while an artist can arrange the subjects/objects in a scene to elicit emotions. Since a photograph captures a single point in time, pacing is an important aspect of how a photograph communicates.
<p>
</p><p><strong>DEEPNESS &amp; LIGHT</strong>
</p>Landscape photographers strive to communicate a spatial viewpoint (where things are in relation to the viewer). By composition, concentration, focal length, and illumination, they can convey depth. They normally want it to be in focus enough that you feel like you're in the picture, but to welcome you into the scene, the landscaper can use objects carefully. Consider two parts of a large river: one with just water from bank to bank and the other with stepping stones. You'll also pay more attention to the section of stepping stones because, even though you don't want to cross, the invitation is there, and this causes you to think. The landscape photographer will look for things in the foreground that will entice you to enter the picture.
