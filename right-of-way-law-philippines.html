Poverty is not a hindrance to success. If a person has strong determination to succeed he will strivehard to get it. There are many ways to reach one's goal. A person must work hard and believe on hisability.8. Honesty should start in early stage of life. A child should be taught not to tell lies at the age of three. Ifa child knows to tell lies in his/her early age he/she will be dishonest in the future. He/She will be usedto it and worst he/she can do crimes in the future.9. Death penalty should not be done. It is against the law of God. Killing a person is a sin. The life thatwe have is a gift from above and its only God who can take it back.10. Family is more important than wealth. Good parents are the treasures beyond wealth. They raise youto become better in the future. They provide everything for you to survive. They are the persons whowant the best for you.

                                            Opinion 1: Filipinos should rejoice that the UN Tribunal has upheld their right to the islands and waters of the Spratlys. It is but right that the Philippines has gained this victory over a known super power not through force of arms, but by engaging the global community and appealing to the rule of law. The Tribunal's decision both upholds the UNCLOS as the primary basis for determining matters related to territorial waters and provides nations an example of how the rule of law and due process, when properly observed, can bring about a fair resolution. With this victory, the Philippines can now confidently face China in negotiating the rights to the territorial waters in the Spratlys. Armed with the conviction that the Filipino people and its government are in the right; Filipino negotiators will now be able to ask for more equitable terms regarding access to and use of resources in the disputed area. International opinion can also be used to convince China to scale back on its activities in the Spratlys islands, and this hopefully will put a stop to the construction of facilities and their increasing military presence in the disputed islands. The decision has made diplomacy the only option to resolve the issue regarding the Spratlys. The region and the world will not benefit if the Philippines and China, along with the other claimant countries, abandon dialogue and resort to force to push their respective claims. With the support of its international partners, the Philippines can now justly assert its rights and enjoin all involved parties to uphold respect for international law. Opinion 2: China will never recognize the UN Tribunal decision and will continue its activities in the disputed Spratly islands. Ever since the Philippines filed its cases against China at the United Nations, the Chines government has dismissed the proceeding and has not participated in any of the hearings of the Tribunal. This shows China's utter disregard for international rule of law and its lack of respect for the UNCLOS, a document to which China is a signing party. The military and economic ambitions of China will continue to fuel its desire to occupy more territory. If China does not give way despite the decision and the overwhelming international pressure, what will stop it from occupying islands that actually belong to the Philippines? The continued presence of Chinese forces in the islands is a disaster waiting to happen. Given that they have control over many islands and have been harassing Filipino fishermen who go into its nearby waters, what will stop the Chinese from 26​</a>

Phase Out the Obsolete Jeepney  (an excerpt)  
By: Neal H. Cruz
If the jeepney strike pushes through today, the government should use it to phase out the jeepneys. This World War II relic should have been phased out a long time ago but successive administrations had no balls to go through with the phase out. They were afraid of the jeepney drivers who always threatened a strike when they were told to obey the law. And there were not enough buses to replace the jeepneys to service commuters.
But the jeepney, although a tourist attraction and a romantic example of folk art, is the principal source of the daily traffic jams. Its drivers are undisciplined, reckless and probably don’t know half of the traffic rules. Because of the huge number of vehicles in Metro Manila, there is only one way to improve traffic: make each and every driver, private and public, obey each and every traffic rule.
Jeepney drivers have gotten away for so long with murder by bribing corrupt policemen that it is a shock to them to be made to obey traffic rules and be fined if they violate them. Anarchy reigns in the streets because of them.
Although they are not in the driver’s seat, jeepney operators are also to blame for the anarchy. They make the drivers pay a flat rental (the boundary) for the jeepney. Whatever the driver earns in excess of the boundary, plus the cost of fuel and oil-and bribes- is his take home pay. So the driver is forced to break traffic rules so that he can earn as much as he can. But that is no excuse.
Perhaps if the operator pays his driver a regular salary, plus social security and mediocre premiums, and fixed times for trips, the driver would be less reckless and we would have more orderly traffic.
As for the jeepney terminals, they really are a source of traffic congestion. Try this: whenever you come to a traffic jam, trace the source and in may cases it would be a jeepney terminal. Jeepneys lined up along narrow street take up space intended for moving vehicles. Some jeepney routes are too short, which means more terminal- and bigger fares for passengers.
Another reason why the jeepney should be phased out is that it takes up too much road space and consumes more fuel for the number of passengers it can accommodate. One bus can take in passengers of ten jeepneys but take up only a fourth of the space occupied by the 10 jeepneys. In short, the jeepney is all right in the provinces where there is ample road space but not in a crowded metropolis like Metro Manila. It was a great as emergency civilian transportation during the Liberation days, but not anymore. Alas, it has become obsolete in the city.
The phase out doesn’t mean throwing the jeepneys into the junk heap and their drivers into the ranks of the jobless. There is a great need for the jeepney in many areas of the Philippines where there is a shortage of transportation. Send them there.
Where will the commuters ride without the jeepneys? Send in more buses with salaried drivers and conductors and fixed trip schedules so they don’t have to clog loading//unloading zones waiting for passengers. Organize the bus companies in Metro Manila into one super-consortium so that the bus ticket of one company can be used to transfer to another bus of a different company. This is to prevent passengers and buses clogging bus stops because they are waiting for the bus going exactly to where they are going. If transfers are allowed, they can board any bus going in the same direction (and the bus doesn’t have to wait long for passsengers) and then transfer to another bus at their convenience.
Encourage commuters to use the Metrotren by improving the coaches and having more trips.
Use the Pasig River. The Metro Ferry failed because there were not enough passengers mainly because the boats are small. Hongkong type shallow-drift ferries will certainly attract more passengers. Use the smaller boats during high tide to be able to pass under the bridges. Have another ferry service to Cavite City to relieve traffic on Coastal Road. (There used to be one; why was it discontinued?)
And hurry up with the C-5 and the C-6…</a>

rules. Because of the huge number of vehicles in Metro Manila, there is only one way to improve the traffic: make each and every driver, private and public, obey each and every traffic rule. 
Jeepney drivers have gotten away for so long with murder by bribing corrupt policemen that it is a shock to them to
be made to obey traffic rules and be fined if they violate them. Anarchy reigns in the streets because of them.
Although they are not in the driver’s seat, jeepney operators are also to blame for the anarchy. They make the drivers pay a flat rental (the boundary) for the jeepney. Whatever the drivers earns in excess of the boundary, plus the cost of fuel and oil-and bribes-is his take home pay. So the driver is forced to break traffic rules so that he can earn as much as he can. But that is no excuse.
Perhaps if the operator pays his driver a regular salary, plus social security and medicare premiums, and fixed times for trips, the driver would be less reckless and we would have more orderly traffic.
As for the jeepney terminals, they really are a source of traffic congestion. Try this: whenever you come to a traffic jam, trace the source and in many cases it would be a jeepney terminal. Jeepneys lined up along a narrow street take up space intended for moving vehicles. Some jeepney routes are too short, which means more terminals-and bigger fares for passengers.
Another reason why the jeepney should be phased out is that it takes up too much road space and consumes more fuel for the number of passengers it can accommodate. One bus can take in the passengers of 10 jeepneys but take up
only a fourth of the space occupied by the 10 jeepneys. In short, the jeepneys is all right in the provinces where there is ample road space but not in a crowded metropolis like Metro Manila. It was great as emergency civilian transportation
during the Liberation days, but not anymore. Alas, it has become obsolete in the city.
The phase out doesn’t mean throwing the jeepneys into the junk heap and their drivers into the ranks of the jobless. There is a great need for the jeepney in many areas of the Philippines where there is a shortage of transportation. Send them there.
Where will the commuters ride without the jeepneys? Send in more buses with salaried drivers and conductors and fixed trip schedules so they don’t have to clog loading/unloading zones waiting for passengers. Organize the bus companies in Metro Manila into one super-consortium so that the bus ticket of one company can be used to transfer to another bus of a different company. This is to prevent passengers and busses clogging bus stops because they are waiting for the bus going exactly to where they are going. If transfers are allowed, they can board any bus going in the same direction (and the bus doesn’t have to wait for long for passengers) and then transfer to another bus at their convenience.
Encourage commuters to use the Metroten by improving the coaches and having more trips.
Use the Pasig River. The Metro Ferry failed because there were not enough passengers mainly because the boats were small. Hong Kong type shallow-drift ferries will certainly attract more passengers. Use the smaller boats during high
tide to be able to pass under the bridges. Have another ferry service to Cavite City to relieve traffic on Coastal Road. (There used to be one; why was it discontinued?)

   The Philippines' Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020
The Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 amends the Human Security Act of 2007. It expands the definition of terrorism to include acts intended to cause "death or serious bodily injury to any person," "extensive damage and destruction" to a government facility, private property or critical infrastructure and when the purpose of those acts is to "intimidate [the] general public," "create an atmosphere or message of fear," or "seriously destabilize or destroy the fundamental political, economic and social structures of the country." Those found guilty face life sentences without the chance of parole.
The act also criminalizes the "threat, planning, training, facilitating of" and "proposal" and "inciting" to terrorist activities by means of speeches, proclamations, writings, banners and emblems. It also subjects suspects to surveillance, warrantless arrest and detention for up to 24 days. In addition, it removes compensation for the suspect in the event of acquittal and boosts the Anti-Terrorism Council, the implementer of the law, whose members are appointed by the president.

   Meanwhile, the Philippines' Commission on Human Rights said the broad definition of "terrorism" in the bill "paves the road for possible abuse."
"By this broad definition, starting a fight in a bar could technically be classified as an act of terrorism," said Human Rights Watch, which called the act "a human rights disaster in the making."

Having read all these details about the bill, especially the statement of the Philippines' Commission on Human Rights about the broad definition of the word “terrorism” which caused confusion or worse misunderstanding and disagreement, it is safe to say that certain words can evoke feelings or make people think in a different way. If you were to be asked about the bill, what is your stand it? Do you support the bill into becoming a law or would you agree on what the opposition stated? Tell us what is on your mind! Write a persuading three-paragraph essay focusing on your position about it.
On the first paragraph, briefly discuss the bill with your stand. On the second paragraph, enumerate and explain your reasons and on the concluding paragraph, give your final message addressed to the government and fellowmen.

Princess Urduja is a mere legend, and not a historical figure.
According to legend, the Filipino heroine Princess Urduja ruled an island called Tawalisi in the 14th century. She led a group of warrior women called Kinalakihan, or the Amazons, across battlefields, and was known for her kindness and intelligence. She is said to have taken no husband because she would only choose a man who was braver, wiser, and stronger than she was, and nobody had enough guts to try to beat her in battle. However, it’s also believed by many that Urduja actually existed — as there were records of her in the accounts of Moroccan traveler and scholar Ibn Battuta. A common theory is that Tawalisi was located in what is now known as Pangasinan, although common guesses for the princess’ native home also include Java, Cambodia, and China.
Lapu-Lapu killed Ferdinand Magellan.
Even first-graders know Lapu-Lapu, the ruler of Mactan who is also the first Philippine hero. He led his men to win the battle of Mactan against Portuguese colonizer Ferdinand Magellan (who probably preferred to be called “explorer” and, by the way, obviously did not “discover” the Philippines), and is usually said to have killed Magellan in the fight. The image may inspire nationalism, but the truth is, it’s impossible to tell whether Magellan did lose his life directly at the hands of Lapu-Lapu, who may be less young and vital than he is commonly depicted.
Jose Rizal wrote “Sa Aking Mga Kabata” in his childhood.
The poem “Sa Aking Mga Kabata,” written in Tagalog about embracing one’s native language, is often attributed to Dr. Jose Rizal, who supposedly wrote it when he was seven years old — “proof,” according to some, of his precocious nature and love of country. Historians such as Ambeth Ocampo, however, have researched and written in opposition of this, stating that there’s no evidence (whether it be a manuscript, a published byline, or an assertion from Rizal himself) supporting Rizal’s authorship of the work. In addition to this, Rizal did not have a strong enough command of Tagalog to match the fluency of the poem.
The viral love letter “Liham Para Kay Oryang” was written by Andres Bonifacio.
In 2015, the work of epistolary fiction “Liham Para Kay Oryang,” written by playwright Eljay Castro Deldoc as though it were a letter from Andres Bonifacio to his wife Gregoria de Jesus a few nights before he was killed, went viral on social media and reached far enough that people began to believe Bonifacio had actually written it. It was romantic and relayed the urgency of love and loss during wartime — but it was just the writer’s interpretation of historical events. On that note, a real poem written by Gregoria de Jesus, titled “Magmula, Giliw, Nang Ikaw ay Pumanaw,” was verified by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines. Talking about her grief over losing Bonifacio, it was copied by hand by her second husband Julio Nakpil, and is now on display in the Bahay-Nakpil museum.
Fernando Poe Sr. served as the model for the Oblation.
Commissioned for the University of the Philippines by then-president Rafael Palma and funded by the enrollees in 1935, the iconic statue known as the Oblation, or simply Oble, was created by Guillermo E. Tolentino and based on Rizal’s poem “Mi Ultimo Adios.” The symbol and touchstone of any UP campus is often said to have taken its physique from actor-director Fernando Poe, Sr., who was a UP student at the time of its creation; however, records show that Anastacio Caedo, a student assistant of Tolentino’s, and Caedo’s brother-in-law Virgilio Raymundo served as the models and references. Another fact that might not be all that well known? The original sculpture is located not in front of Quezon Hall along UP Diliman’s University Avenue, but instead inside Gonzales Hall.
The yo-yo was invented by ancient Filipinos.
It’s too simple to say the yo-yo was invented by a Filipino, and it’s almost impossible to determine its true origins: it traces its existence back to ancient Greece and arrived in Europe in the 1800s, long before it was trademarked and sold en masse in America. But in the late 1920s, a Filipino bellboy named Pedro Flores, who had traveled to the United States in hopes of studying law, innovated a stringing method that elevated the yo-yo from being a simple toy to the type we all know and can do tricks with today. He mass-produced his creation and established a yo-yo manufacturing company, but eventually sold the rights.</a>

                                            Opinion 1:Filipinos should rejoice that the UN Tribunal has upheld their right to the islands and waters of Spratlys. It is but right that the Philippines has gained this victory over a known superpower not through force of arms , but engaging the global community and appealing to the rule of law. The Tribunal’s decision both upholds the UNCLOS as the primary basis for determining matters related to territorial waters and provides nations an example of how rule of law and due process, when properly observed, can bring about a fair solution. With this victory, the Philippines can now confidently face China in negotiating the rights to the territorial waters in Spratlys. Armed with the conviction that the Filipino people and its government are in the right, Filipino negotiators will now be able to ask for more equitable terms regarding access to and use of resources in the disputed area. International opinion can also be used to convince China to scale back on its activities in the Spratly islands, and this hopefully will put a stop to the construction of facilities and their increasing military presence in the disputed islands. The decision has made diplomacy the only option to resolve the issue regarding the Spratlys. The region and the world will not benefit if the Philippines and China, along with the other claimant countries it, abandon dialogue and resort to force to push their respective claims. With the support of its international partners, the Philippines can now justly assert its rights and enjoin all involved parties to uphold respect for international. Opinion 2: China will never recognize the UN Tribunal decision and will continue its activities in the disputed Spratly islands. Ever since the Philippines filed its case against China at the United Nations, the Chinese government has dismissed the proceedings and has not participated in any of the hearings of the Tribunal. This shows China’s utter disregard for international rule of law and its lack of respect for the UNCLOS, a document to which China is a signing party. The military and economic ambitions of C more China will continue to fuel its desire to occupy more territory. If China does not give way despite the decision and the overwhelming international pressure, what will stop it from occupying islands that actually belong to the Philippines?  The continued presence of Chinese forces in the islands is a disaster waiting to happen. Given that they have control over many islands and have been harassing Filipino fishermen who go into its nearby waters, what will stop the Chinese from using destructive and deadly force on any ship that dares to trespass in their socalled territories? Nothing short of a war will convince China that its territorial ambitions have already exceeded the tolerance of the world. ​What are the merits of the opinions given?</a>

                                            ACTIVITY 1: You be the Judge of it! Though it seems that society is winning in the battle against illegal drug use and abuse, I believe that we are still a long way from declaring victory in the battle. Teenagers are still victimized by drug addiction. Everyone complains? But only a few are some suggestions to stop this terrible and frightening habit. First, the film industry should stop glamorizing drug addiction. Drug addicts and drug pushers should not come out as heroes and saints in films and television programs. They should realize that young people look up to these actors and actresses and what they portray on camera is something that looks cool and good for the young viewers. The government and the actors' guild should come up with a law banning the industry from showing drugs of all forms on television and film. Second, the government should have strict laws and policies on drug trafficking and possession of drugs and their paraphernalia. We should follow our neighboring countries which include death penalties as sanction to drug traffickers. Right now, the Philippines serve as a drop-off point for drugs coming from other countries. Drug Laboratories have been discovered in residential houses and old abandoned factories. Foreign members of syndicates have been caught and charged by authorities. These are proofs that there is a need to review and revise our present laws on drug abuse and trafficking. Third, horrific videos of people dying from drug-related illnesses should be used by the government as advocacy materials for students to see and know the real deal about drug use and abuse. If students will understand the ugly truth about drugs through these advocacies and they will no longer start to take drugs, then the approach will be effective and the experience worthwhile. There are still more ideas I can share with you regarding drug abuse prevention but I think that these three suggestions are more than enough to change the scenario. My parting words are to "think several times before acting out foolishly". The Editor - 1. Questions: What are the ideas of the editor to stop drug use, abuse, and drug trafficking? Summarize these ideas. 2. Do you think the idea of the editor will be effective? Why or why not? 3. Do you have other ideas that might help stop drug use, abuse, and trafficking? Write one idea in each box.​</a>

And it is so hard to accept the fact that the innocent children are the one who are affected too much.  At their very young age, they are taught how to earn for a living, just for their own selves and for their family as well.

You have to pay first to have a security of your future, which is not present to the poor ones.  Your education seems to be endangered when you are poor.  There are instances that you have to be absent because your money is not enough.  And of course, your grade will be affected.  When a student is poor, his seems to be miserable.  He cannot pay the obliged school fees for his money is only enough for personal necessities, but sometimes, it is not even enough.  He cannot avail the required projects.  Even a single peso is very important. Every single peso is his future.  That is what a typical poor student is experiencing<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope its help</p><br />

                            5. Opinion 1: Filipinos should rejoice that the UN Tribunal has upheld their right to the islands and waters of the Spratlys. It is but right that the Philippines has gained this victory over a known super power not through force of arms, but by engaging the global community and appealing to the rule of law. The Tribunal's decision both upholds the UNCLOS as the primary basis for determining matters related to territorial waters and provides nations an example of how the rule of law and due process, when properly observed, can bring about a fair resolution. With this victory, the Philippines can now confidently face China in negotiating the rights to the territorial waters in the Spratlys. Armed with the conviction that the Filipino people and its government are in the right; Filipino negotiators will now be able to ask for more equitable terms regarding access to and use of resources in the disputed area. International opinion can also be used to convince China to scale back on its activities in the Spratlys islands, and this hopefully will put a stop to the construction of facilities and their increasing military presence in the disputed islands. The decision has made diplomacy the only option to resolve the issue regarding the Spratlys. The region and the world will not benefit if the Philippines and China, along with the other claimant countries, abandon dialogue and resort to force to push their respective claims. With the support of its international partners, the Philippines can now justly assert its rights and enjoin all involved parties to uphold respect for international law. Opinion 2: China will never recognize the UN Tribunal decision and will continue its activities in the disputed Spratly islands. Ever since the Philippines filed its cases against China at the United Nations, the Chines government has dismissed the proceeding and has not participated in any of the hearings of the Tribunal. This shows China's utter disregard for international rule of law and its lack of respect for the UNCLOS, a document to which China is a signing party. The military and economic ambitions of China will continue to fuel its desire to occupy more territory. If China does not give way despite the decision and the overwhelming international pressure, what will stop it from occupying islands that actually belong to the Philippines? The continued presence of Chinese forces in the islands is a disaster waiting to happen. Given that they have control over many islands and have been harassing Filipino fishermen who go into its nearby waters, what will stop the Chinese from 26​</h2><br />

Phase Out the Obsolete Jeepney  (an excerpt)  
By: Neal H. Cruz
If the jeepney strike pushes through today, the government should use it to phase out the jeepneys. This World War II relic should have been phased out a long time ago but successive administrations had no balls to go through with the phase out. They were afraid of the jeepney drivers who always threatened a strike when they were told to obey the law. And there were not enough buses to replace the jeepneys to service commuters.
But the jeepney, although a tourist attraction and a romantic example of folk art, is the principal source of the daily traffic jams. Its drivers are undisciplined, reckless and probably don’t know half of the traffic rules. Because of the huge number of vehicles in Metro Manila, there is only one way to improve traffic: make each and every driver, private and public, obey each and every traffic rule.
Jeepney drivers have gotten away for so long with murder by bribing corrupt policemen that it is a shock to them to be made to obey traffic rules and be fined if they violate them. Anarchy reigns in the streets because of them.
Although they are not in the driver’s seat, jeepney operators are also to blame for the anarchy. They make the drivers pay a flat rental (the boundary) for the jeepney. Whatever the driver earns in excess of the boundary, plus the cost of fuel and oil-and bribes- is his take home pay. So the driver is forced to break traffic rules so that he can earn as much as he can. But that is no excuse.
Perhaps if the operator pays his driver a regular salary, plus social security and mediocre premiums, and fixed times for trips, the driver would be less reckless and we would have more orderly traffic.
As for the jeepney terminals, they really are a source of traffic congestion. Try this: whenever you come to a traffic jam, trace the source and in may cases it would be a jeepney terminal. Jeepneys lined up along narrow street take up space intended for moving vehicles. Some jeepney routes are too short, which means more terminal- and bigger fares for passengers.
Another reason why the jeepney should be phased out is that it takes up too much road space and consumes more fuel for the number of passengers it can accommodate. One bus can take in passengers of ten jeepneys but take up only a fourth of the space occupied by the 10 jeepneys. In short, the jeepney is all right in the provinces where there is ample road space but not in a crowded metropolis like Metro Manila. It was a great as emergency civilian transportation during the Liberation days, but not anymore. Alas, it has become obsolete in the city.
The phase out doesn’t mean throwing the jeepneys into the junk heap and their drivers into the ranks of the jobless. There is a great need for the jeepney in many areas of the Philippines where there is a shortage of transportation. Send them there.
Where will the commuters ride without the jeepneys? Send in more buses with salaried drivers and conductors and fixed trip schedules so they don’t have to clog loading//unloading zones waiting for passengers. Organize the bus companies in Metro Manila into one super-consortium so that the bus ticket of one company can be used to transfer to another bus of a different company. This is to prevent passengers and buses clogging bus stops because they are waiting for the bus going exactly to where they are going. If transfers are allowed, they can board any bus going in the same direction (and the bus doesn’t have to wait long for passsengers) and then transfer to another bus at their convenience.
Encourage commuters to use the Metrotren by improving the coaches and having more trips.
Use the Pasig River. The Metro Ferry failed because there were not enough passengers mainly because the boats are small. Hongkong type shallow-drift ferries will certainly attract more passengers. Use the smaller boats during high tide to be able to pass under the bridges. Have another ferry service to Cavite City to relieve traffic on Coastal Road.

                            8. Phase Out the Obsolete Jeepney (an excerpt)
Neal H. Cruz
If the jeepney strike pushes through today, the government should use it to phase out the jeepneys. This World War II relic should have been phased out a long time ago but successive administrations had no balls to go through with the phaseout. They were afraid of the jeepney drivers who always threatened a strike when they were told to obey the law. And there were not enough buses to replace the jeepneys to service commuters.
 But the jeepney, although a tourist attraction and a romantic example of a romantic example of folk art, is the principal source of the daily traffic jams. Its drivers are undisciplined, reckless and probably don’t know half of the traffic
rules. Because of the huge number of vehicles in Metro Manila, there is only one way to improve the traffic: make each and every driver, private and public, obey each and every traffic rule. 
Jeepney drivers have gotten away for so long with murder by bribing corrupt policemen that it is a shock to them to
be made to obey traffic rules and be fined if they violate them. Anarchy reigns in the streets because of them.
Although they are not in the driver’s seat, jeepney operators are also to blame for the anarchy. They make the drivers pay a flat rental (the boundary) for the jeepney. Whatever the drivers earns in excess of the boundary, plus the cost of fuel and oil-and bribes-is his take home pay. So the driver is forced to break traffic rules so that he can earn as much as he can. But that is no excuse.
Perhaps if the operator pays his driver a regular salary, plus social security and medicare premiums, and fixed times for trips, the driver would be less reckless and we would have more orderly traffic.
As for the jeepney terminals, they really are a source of traffic congestion. Try this: whenever you come to a traffic jam, trace the source and in many cases it would be a jeepney terminal. Jeepneys lined up along a narrow street take up space intended for moving vehicles. Some jeepney routes are too short, which means more terminals-and bigger fares for passengers.
Another reason why the jeepney should be phased out is that it takes up too much road space and consumes more fuel for the number of passengers it can accommodate. One bus can take in the passengers of 10 jeepneys but take up
only a fourth of the space occupied by the 10 jeepneys. In short, the jeepneys is all right in the provinces where there is ample road space but not in a crowded metropolis like Metro Manila. It was great as emergency civilian transportation
during the Liberation days, but not anymore. Alas, it has become obsolete in the city.
The phase out doesn’t mean throwing the jeepneys into the junk heap and their drivers into the ranks of the jobless. There is a great need for the jeepney in many areas of the Philippines where there is a shortage of transportation. Send them there.
Where will the commuters ride without the jeepneys? Send in more buses with salaried drivers and conductors and fixed trip schedules so they don’t have to clog loading/unloading zones waiting for passengers. Organize the bus companies in Metro Manila into one super-consortium so that the bus ticket of one company can be used to transfer to another bus of a different company. This is to prevent passengers and busses clogging bus stops because they are waiting for the bus going exactly to where they are going. If transfers are allowed, they can board any bus going in the same direction (and the bus doesn’t have to wait for long for passengers) and then transfer to another bus at their convenience.
Encourage commuters to use the Metroten by improving the coaches and having more trips.
Use the Pasig River. The Metro Ferry failed because there were not enough passengers mainly because the boats were small. Hong Kong type shallow-drift ferries will certainly attract more passengers. Use the smaller boats during high
tide to be able to pass under the bridges. Have another ferry service to Cavite City to relieve traffic on Coastal Road. (There used to be one; why was it discontinued?)

   The Philippines' Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020
The Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 amends the Human Security Act of 2007. It expands the definition of terrorism to include acts intended to cause "death or serious bodily injury to any person," "extensive damage and destruction" to a government facility, private property or critical infrastructure and when the purpose of those acts is to "intimidate [the] general public," "create an atmosphere or message of fear," or "seriously destabilize or destroy the fundamental political, economic and social structures of the country." Those found guilty face life sentences without the chance of parole.
The act also criminalizes the "threat, planning, training, facilitating of" and "proposal" and "inciting" to terrorist activities by means of speeches, proclamations, writings, banners and emblems. It also subjects suspects to surveillance, warrantless arrest and detention for up to 24 days. In addition, it removes compensation for the suspect in the event of acquittal and boosts the Anti-Terrorism Council, the implementer of the law, whose members are appointed by the president.

   Meanwhile, the Philippines' Commission on Human Rights said the broad definition of "terrorism" in the bill "paves the road for possible abuse."
"By this broad definition, starting a fight in a bar could technically be classified as an act of terrorism," said Human Rights Watch, which called the act "a human rights disaster in the making."

Having read all these details about the bill, especially the statement of the Philippines' Commission on Human Rights about the broad definition of the word “terrorism” which caused confusion or worse misunderstanding and disagreement, it is safe to say that certain words can evoke feelings or make people think in a different way. If you were to be asked about the bill, what is your stand it? Do you support the bill into becoming a law or would you agree on what the opposition stated? Tell us what is on your mind! Write a persuading three-paragraph essay focusing on your position about it.
On the first paragraph, briefly discuss the bill with your stand. On the second paragraph, enumerate and explain your reasons and on the concluding paragraph, give your final message addressed to the government and fellowmen.

Princess Urduja is a mere legend, and not a historical figure.
According to legend, the Filipino heroine Princess Urduja ruled an island called Tawalisi in the 14th century. She led a group of warrior women called Kinalakihan, or the Amazons, across battlefields, and was known for her kindness and intelligence. She is said to have taken no husband because she would only choose a man who was braver, wiser, and stronger than she was, and nobody had enough guts to try to beat her in battle. However, it’s also believed by many that Urduja actually existed — as there were records of her in the accounts of Moroccan traveler and scholar Ibn Battuta. A common theory is that Tawalisi was located in what is now known as Pangasinan, although common guesses for the princess’ native home also include Java, Cambodia, and China.
Lapu-Lapu killed Ferdinand Magellan.
Even first-graders know Lapu-Lapu, the ruler of Mactan who is also the first Philippine hero. He led his men to win the battle of Mactan against Portuguese colonizer Ferdinand Magellan (who probably preferred to be called “explorer” and, by the way, obviously did not “discover” the Philippines), and is usually said to have killed Magellan in the fight. The image may inspire nationalism, but the truth is, it’s impossible to tell whether Magellan did lose his life directly at the hands of Lapu-Lapu, who may be less young and vital than he is commonly depicted.
Jose Rizal wrote “Sa Aking Mga Kabata” in his childhood.
The poem “Sa Aking Mga Kabata,” written in Tagalog about embracing one’s native language, is often attributed to Dr. Jose Rizal, who supposedly wrote it when he was seven years old — “proof,” according to some, of his precocious nature and love of country. Historians such as Ambeth Ocampo, however, have researched and written in opposition of this, stating that there’s no evidence (whether it be a manuscript, a published byline, or an assertion from Rizal himself) supporting Rizal’s authorship of the work. In addition to this, Rizal did not have a strong enough command of Tagalog to match the fluency of the poem.
The viral love letter “Liham Para Kay Oryang” was written by Andres Bonifacio.
In 2015, the work of epistolary fiction “Liham Para Kay Oryang,” written by playwright Eljay Castro Deldoc as though it were a letter from Andres Bonifacio to his wife Gregoria de Jesus a few nights before he was killed, went viral on social media and reached far enough that people began to believe Bonifacio had actually written it. It was romantic and relayed the urgency of love and loss during wartime — but it was just the writer’s interpretation of historical events. On that note, a real poem written by Gregoria de Jesus, titled “Magmula, Giliw, Nang Ikaw ay Pumanaw,” was verified by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines. Talking about her grief over losing Bonifacio, it was copied by hand by her second husband Julio Nakpil, and is now on display in the Bahay-Nakpil museum.
Fernando Poe Sr. served as the model for the Oblation.
Commissioned for the University of the Philippines by then-president Rafael Palma and funded by the enrollees in 1935, the iconic statue known as the Oblation, or simply Oble, was created by Guillermo E. Tolentino and based on Rizal’s poem “Mi Ultimo Adios.” The symbol and touchstone of any UP campus is often said to have taken its physique from actor-director Fernando Poe, Sr., who was a UP student at the time of its creation; however, records show that Anastacio Caedo, a student assistant of Tolentino’s, and Caedo’s brother-in-law Virgilio Raymundo served as the models and references. Another fact that might not be all that well known? The original sculpture is located not in front of Quezon Hall along UP Diliman’s University Avenue, but instead inside Gonzales Hall.
The yo-yo was invented by ancient Filipinos.
It’s too simple to say the yo-yo was invented by a Filipino, and it’s almost impossible to determine its true origins: it traces its existence back to ancient Greece and arrived in Europe in the 1800s, long before it was trademarked and sold en masse in America. But in the late 1920s, a Filipino bellboy named Pedro Flores, who had traveled to the United States in hopes of studying law, innovated a stringing method that elevated the yo-yo from being a simple toy to the type we all know and can do tricks with today. He mass-produced his creation and established a yo-yo manufacturing company, but eventually sold the rights.</h2><br />

                            23. Opinion 1:Filipinos should rejoice that the UN Tribunal has upheld their right to the islands and waters of Spratlys. It is but right that the Philippines has gained this victory over a known superpower not through force of arms , but engaging the global community and appealing to the rule of law. The Tribunal’s decision both upholds the UNCLOS as the primary basis for determining matters related to territorial waters and provides nations an example of how rule of law and due process, when properly observed, can bring about a fair solution. With this victory, the Philippines can now confidently face China in negotiating the rights to the territorial waters in Spratlys. Armed with the conviction that the Filipino people and its government are in the right, Filipino negotiators will now be able to ask for more equitable terms regarding access to and use of resources in the disputed area. International opinion can also be used to convince China to scale back on its activities in the Spratly islands, and this hopefully will put a stop to the construction of facilities and their increasing military presence in the disputed islands. The decision has made diplomacy the only option to resolve the issue regarding the Spratlys. The region and the world will not benefit if the Philippines and China, along with the other claimant countries it, abandon dialogue and resort to force to push their respective claims. With the support of its international partners, the Philippines can now justly assert its rights and enjoin all involved parties to uphold respect for international. Opinion 2: China will never recognize the UN Tribunal decision and will continue its activities in the disputed Spratly islands. Ever since the Philippines filed its case against China at the United Nations, the Chinese government has dismissed the proceedings and has not participated in any of the hearings of the Tribunal. This shows China’s utter disregard for international rule of law and its lack of respect for the UNCLOS, a document to which China is a signing party. The military and economic ambitions of C more China will continue to fuel its desire to occupy more territory. If China does not give way despite the decision and the overwhelming international pressure, what will stop it from occupying islands that actually belong to the Philippines?  The continued presence of Chinese forces in the islands is a disaster waiting to happen. Given that they have control over many islands and have been harassing Filipino fishermen who go into its nearby waters, what will stop the Chinese from using destructive and deadly force on any ship that dares to trespass in their socalled territories? Nothing short of a war will convince China that its territorial ambitions have already exceeded the tolerance of the world. ​What are the merits of the opinions given?</h2><br />

                            24. ACTIVITY 1: You be the Judge of it! Though it seems that society is winning in the battle against illegal drug use and abuse, I believe that we are still a long way from declaring victory in the battle. Teenagers are still victimized by drug addiction. Everyone complains? But only a few are some suggestions to stop this terrible and frightening habit. First, the film industry should stop glamorizing drug addiction. Drug addicts and drug pushers should not come out as heroes and saints in films and television programs. They should realize that young people look up to these actors and actresses and what they portray on camera is something that looks cool and good for the young viewers. The government and the actors' guild should come up with a law banning the industry from showing drugs of all forms on television and film. Second, the government should have strict laws and policies on drug trafficking and possession of drugs and their paraphernalia. We should follow our neighboring countries which include death penalties as sanction to drug traffickers. Right now, the Philippines serve as a drop-off point for drugs coming from other countries. Drug Laboratories have been discovered in residential houses and old abandoned factories. Foreign members of syndicates have been caught and charged by authorities. These are proofs that there is a need to review and revise our present laws on drug abuse and trafficking. Third, horrific videos of people dying from drug-related illnesses should be used by the government as advocacy materials for students to see and know the real deal about drug use and abuse. If students will understand the ugly truth about drugs through these advocacies and they will no longer start to take drugs, then the approach will be effective and the experience worthwhile. There are still more ideas I can share with you regarding drug abuse prevention but I think that these three suggestions are more than enough to change the scenario. My parting words are to "think several times before acting out foolishly". The Editor - 1. Questions: What are the ideas of the editor to stop drug use, abuse, and drug trafficking? Summarize these ideas. 2. Do you think the idea of the editor will be effective? Why or why not? 3. Do you have other ideas that might help stop drug use, abuse, and trafficking? Write one idea in each box.​</h2><br />
