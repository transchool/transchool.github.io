                        Have you ever bullied or been bullied? If you have bullied or been bullied then you should know how bullying feels like. Bullying is very negative and creates major problems for our society. Nothing good comes out of bullying. It could very well change or ruin a person's life. In fact, it does ruin many people's lives. Kids can be mentally scarred if they are teased often. Even worse, they could be killed or fatally injured if the bullying gets extreme. There are many causes for bullying which must be taken care of before bullying can be stopped. T.V. violence, families in poverty, and mis-teachings are just several of the many serious causes for bullying. Bullying must be stopped or prevented no matter how long it will take, it is a deeply concerning matter.<br />             Bullying does not always have to be childish play, it can be extremely violent. People may be bruised, injured, or even killed. Kids under bad influence may turn very violent. Parents, relatives, friends, T.V., music and pictures may all influence people, especially when they are depressed or are in a lowered state of mind. Violence on T.V. is a very big influence, particularly the wrestling and fighting shows. Also, T.V. shows are quite readily available for anyone to watch. Kids may try "moves" on people at school because they believe it's cool. As well, cooperation from childrens' parents is important, some parents actually encourage their children to fight to look cool or don't teach them properly. Kids must take their own initiative, as well, they must find out what's wrong and what's right for themselves sometimes. Many kids don't take bullying seriously. However, when a real incident occurs, they are unprepared, shocked, regretful, or dead. Bullying must stop, for it is destroying the lives and futures of many innocents, perhaps not killing them, but ruining them. People may end up physically distort...<br />

                        What satisfaction does bullying gives to those bullies? Does it make their tummies full? Does it increases the values they have? Clearly, all living things are possessing imperfections. Yes it is already a human nature to discriminate things or people even on the slightest way but, why does it need to come to a point where the emotional aspect of the victim will be affected?  Let us think about it. We are not on the situation of that victim to be inconsiderate of how they feel. You yourself feels down whenever some insults are thrown at you. You know the feeling of being insulted so might as well, don't let yourself be the cause of other people getting hurt. <br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Cyberbullying is a recent form of aggression that students use to humiliate and attack their less popular peers. Like traditional bullying, this behavior is based on the imbalance of power between bullies and victims and may continue for a long time. Cyberbullying manifests itself in posting and sharing abusive comments, photos, and videos, writing intimidating e-mails and messages, spreading rumors, etc. (Völlink, Dehue, &amp; Guckin, 2015). Unlike face-to-face school bullying, this type of aggression may occur at any time and in any place, so the victim cannot escape it. It is also more difficult to prevent bullying and punish abusers because they often remain anonymous. Cyberbullying has a detrimental effect on victims’ emotional and psychological health, so effective solutions to this phenomenon should be introduced to protect children.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Bullying is an aggressive behavior that is hurtful and often cause embarrassment and intimidates the person being bullied. This can happen to anyone. The people being bullied often feels powerless and alone. Bullying isn’t just punching someone in the face or someone calling horrible names. Bullying is a lot more than that. Bullying isn’t new to the society, it existed long ago but thanks to the development of technology people especially teenagers are now being bullied at home. Cyberbullying is a serious problem that can leave the victims feeling helpless and overwhelmed. This has become one of the most difficult issues to resolve in our society today.</p><p></p><p><strong>If</strong><strong> </strong><strong>you </strong><strong>feel</strong><strong> </strong><strong>like</strong><strong> </strong><strong>it</strong><strong> </strong><strong>lacks </strong><strong>words</strong><strong> </strong><strong>or</strong><strong> </strong><strong>para</strong><strong>graphs</strong><strong> </strong><strong>which</strong><strong> </strong><strong>is</strong><strong> </strong><strong>obvious</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Feel free </strong><strong>to</strong><strong> </strong><strong>add</strong><strong> </strong><strong>some</strong><strong> </strong><strong>more</strong><strong> </strong><strong>or</strong><strong> </strong><strong>just</strong><strong> </strong><strong>them</strong><strong> </strong><strong>so</strong><strong> </strong><strong>you</strong><strong> </strong><strong>could</strong><strong> </strong><strong>create</strong><strong> </strong><strong>para</strong><strong>graphs</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Good</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Luck</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>n school, students indeed experience bullying. May it be offensive words of one's physicality, misunderstanding of words or body language, misjudged, etc.
</p><p>
</p><p>There are three things to consider in a situation of a bully and the victim. We must not forget also the bystander. In my opinion, it is the worst of them all. Why? Because a bystander in a situation like this doesn't care at all, a bystander doesn't care if you're bullied or not. A bystander who doesn't report to the principal's office or stand up for the victim. This type does apply to many, which makes us look like hypocrites. Why hypocrites? Because we're similar to what the bully is doing to the victim. As a matter of fact, not everyone is going to be the bully intentionally but not everyone is going to be the victim. Life is full of choices, you either choose what you're going to do because it's your life. What you do today will affect someone's life, may it be good or bad. What you don't do today will not affect you but you will lose something.
</p><p>
</p><p>How to avoid being a bystander, a bully and a victim of bullying? First, you need to respect yourself first. Why? Because if you know how to respect yourself, you will also know how to respect others. Second, you need to accept people's corrections without lashing out. Lastly, love God before loving yourself, because God is the whole definition of love.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>nabasa ko lng po</p><br />

                        <p>Bullying is a common word that we hear often. It is heard most often in the school yard. What is bullying, and what makes a bully do what he/she does? What types of bullying is there? This essay will discuss all the above and strive to educate, you, the reader on bullying and its harmful effects too.</p><p>Bullying is defined as unwanted, aggressive behaviour. Bullying can have lasting impressions on the bully, as well as, the victim. Most often, children who bully others use their physical strength, popularity or access to some information against the victim to show their powers. This behaviour is repeated over and over and if not stopped can encourage the bully to do worse. How does one know when they are being bullied? Easily. Bullies threaten others. They spread rumours. They attack others verbally or physically. Bullies also do not include anyone they think not suitable in play.</p><p>There are three types of bullying. Some are straightforward and can be identified easily. However, there are some forms of bullying that leaves one wondering if they were bullied at all. The three forms of bullying are verbal bullying, physical bullying and social bullying. We are all aware of verbal and physical bullying. Verbal bullying involves teasing, taunting, name-calling, inappropriate sexual comments etc. Physical bullying involves hitting, kicking, pinching, pushing, shoving, braking another’s things, spitting etc. What is social bullying? Social bullying is very common in the playground, especially when there is a new child. Social bullying involves leaving a new child out of play on purpose, whispering about the child in front of him/her, embarrassing the child in public and not allowing other children to be friendly with the child.</p><p>What makes a bully do the things he does? There is no one single reason for bullying. However, there are a significant amount of reasons that can contribute to the problem. A child who is bullied himself by his peers or siblings can also turn to bullying others. Bullies are often products of overly-permissive or overly strict parents. Parents who find bullying entertaining can also produce a child who will bully others because it is not “wrong”. Children who are troubled or abused and do not know how to handle their problems also turn to bullying as a form of ventilating their frustrations.</p><p>Bullying is something that can be prevented. This has to be handled by parents and school staff. Parents can help children understand what bullying is and explain to the children that bullying is bad. Teachers too should get involved and educate children on the harmful effects of bullying. The most opportune time to prevent bullying is before it begins. Schools should build rules against bullying and bullies should be punished. Teaching children to handle a bully is also a good way of preventing further problems. Bullies get away with bullying because they can. Once they understand that they cannot get away with it, they stop. A clear, calm “no” while looking in the bully’s eye is one way to handle a bully. However, sometimes this does not work. Children should be advised and encouraged to consider outside help before the bullying escalates.</p><p>Students that are bullied at home commonly become the school bullies. They take out their rage on smaller or weaker children in order to give themselves power since they are powerless at home. Another reason a student may bully another is self-protection. Sometimes a child will participate in belittling another person to prevent the bullies from picking on them; they divert the attention to another and become part of the power rather than be victimized.</p><p>Human groups, even children, are made up of leaders and followers. Because of their perceived strength, children often respond to bullies as they would a leader and do what they are told (giving up their lunch money, or doing someone else’s homework). But there is a real difference; a natural leader takes charge with good intentions, while a bully will dominate another person at all costs. There are circumstances where a leader is also a bully, but that is off yopic here. Most bullies have low self-esteem and feel powerless at their core. The dynamic of predator/prey can change for the victim if the bullying is caught early and parental involvement occurs.</p><p>When a parent understands via a bullying essay, video, or a story that bullying is happening on the playground, in the school, on the bus, or online, an honest discussion needs to take place. A parent needs to inform their child that harmful behavior is unacceptable. Teach your child to stand up for themselves consistently, and be unafraid to involve the authorities which includes the school administration. Abusive behavior has consequences, and should not be encouraged to continue. To additionally support their child who is being bullied, parents may keep a journal or have their child write a bullying essay of sorts to express their feelings about the bullying situation.</p><br />
