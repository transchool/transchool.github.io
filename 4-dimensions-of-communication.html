3.	What is the relationship between culture and perception?
4.	How might the differing worldviews of diverse cultures present challenges for intercultural communication?
5.	What assumptions underline the interpretive approach to the study of intercultural communication?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Collectivism stresses the importance of the community, while individualism is focused on the rights and concerns of each person. Where unity and selflessness or altruism are valued traits in collectivist cultures, independence and personal identity are promoted in individualistic cultures.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>2. Anxiety. It is not unusual to experience some level of discomfort in communicating with individuals from other cultures or co-cultures. </strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>3. </strong>Cultural perception is how an individual's culture affects the way he or she's see the world. Since culture informs all areas of life (including the arts, thought, religion, language, food, etc.), perception (how they see the world) is significantly impacted by culture.</p><p></p><p>4. The concept originates from the German word Weltanschauung (“world perception” or “world view”). As a fundamental cognitive construct, intercultural worldview shapes how a culture interprets events and influences intercultural communication and cultural behaviors, a point illustrated throughout this entry.</p><p></p><p>5. The interpretive approach studies culture from the perspective of members of the cultures being studied rather than through a framework imposed by the researcher. Researchers using the interpretive approach are interested in describing culture, not in predicting behavior.</p><br />
