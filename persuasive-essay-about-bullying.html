Individuals should know all of the truth about cyber bullying and the strategies to safeguard themselves from it.<p></p>Bullying affects people in various ways. Bullying is an enormous issue for children and young men and women who go through it. Bullying is most inclined to be found happening among children and is, thus, a quality that assumes proportion for a child itself.<p>#Brainly </p><p>#CarryOnLearning </p><br />

                            2. persuasive essay about cyber bullying​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Cyber bullying is a serious problem in today's digital world, and it is a form of harassment that can have long-lasting effects on the victim. As more and more people spend their time online, cyber bullying has become a pervasive issue that affects people of all ages and backgrounds. In this essay, I will argue that cyber bullying is a harmful and destructive behavior that must be stopped.</p><p></p><p>First and foremost, cyber bullying can have serious psychological effects on the victim. It can lead to depression, anxiety, and other mental health problems. Many victims of cyber bullying also experience social isolation and difficulty forming relationships, which can have a lasting impact on their well-being.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, cyber bullying can lead to physical harm. In some cases, victims of cyber bullying have been driven to self-harm or suicide. This is a tragic outcome that is entirely preventable if we take action to stop cyber bullying.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, cyber bullying can have a negative impact on academic performance. Students who are bullied may struggle to focus on their studies, leading to poor grades and lower academic achievement.</p><p></p><p>In order to combat cyber bullying, we must take a multifaceted approach. Parents, teachers, and other adults must be vigilant in monitoring the online activity of young people and take action if they suspect cyber bullying is occurring. Social media companies must also take responsibility for monitoring their platforms and responding quickly to reports of cyber bullying. We can also promote awareness and education about the impact of cyber bullying through public awareness campaigns and school programs.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, cyber bullying is a destructive behavior that can have serious long-term consequences. It is up to all of us to take action to prevent and stop cyber bullying in our communities. By working together, we can create a safer and more positive digital world for all.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>low bat na ako huhhhuhh</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>persuasive essay about cyber bullyingMost people are aware that bullying is wrong. Using derogatory language against another person is completely pointless. Additionally, while hitting a bully feels good in the moment, it causes long-term harm to the victim. People now have even more opportunities to bully through cyberbullying thanks to the Internet. This includes tweeting defamatory messages, posting fake websites, and sending crude images. A brand-new type of bullying has emerged as a result of cyberbullying. Bullying has the potential to alter the personality of the victim, which is one of its effects. People who are normally happy and confident may become self-conscious, shy, and unsure as a result. Bullying victims may also experience feelings of sadness or depression. They might lose all confidence, which would prevent them from trying new things or trusting other people. A person who has been bullied may be reluctant to participate in activities where they might be ridiculed, such as sports or public speaking. A victim of bullying might even begin to exhibit previously unheard-of anxious behavior.<p></p>Bullying has many negative effects, but there are even more serious ones. Sometimes, people who have been bullied get so upset, scared, or depressed that they don't see their worth and can't get out of their pain. Over the past few years, there have been numerous reports of students taking their own lives as a result of being bullied. In the meantime, there are times when victims have no choice but to seek retribution against the bully and instigators through severe violence. People may lose their capacity for love and trust as a result of bullying, preventing them from having a satisfying relationship in the future. They might find that their partner is submissive, or they might just want to be by themselves. Victims frequently develop eating disorders, begin self-injury, or require extensive counseling, which adds to all of these issues. People who suffer from social bullying may also be left without a group of friends with whom they can lean on and spend time.<p></p>Another unfortunate result of this is that bullying frequently occurs in cycles. In an effort to regain their power and self-esteem, victims of bullying may turn into bullies. In connection with this, bullies who are not confronted or stopped could end up in positions where they can bully adults in the future. Child abusers and bosses who are manipulative come from this.<p></p>In addition to its long-term effects, bullying can have immediate consequences. A punch to the arm caused by one child calling another child names may result in the victim crying and developing a bruise. However, not all of the effects of bullying are immediately apparent. Over time, bullying can cause long-term harm to a person in profound ways that can only get worse. Bullying has so many effects that it is impossible to count or predict them all. Stopping bullying is extremely important for this reason.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>#</strong><strong>C</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>Y</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>G</strong></p><p><strong>#</strong><strong>B</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>Y</strong><strong>F</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>S</strong><strong>T</strong></p><br />

                        <br />We are living in a world where some people think that violence is the only reason to solve every problem.  If people keep this violence around us, it’s not going to get better. Violence has been in this world for centuries now and for the same causes, to gain power of authority. Kids in schools feel superior to others by calling other kids horrible names and making fun of them. Men hit women so they can “earn” their respect back. The point is that violence won’t make you a better person, it will make you a monster and nobody likes a monster.<br /><br />There are many different kinds of violence. One of them is called bullying. The victims of this violence are mostly kids and teenagers around the ages of 10-18. Bullying is when someone says mean things to someone in person or in a social network. Most of the time it happens in the social network because kids thing that by making fun of someone in a social network area, they won’t get in trouble by an adult. This is one of the worst violence in the world because is between kids and teenagers. Most of the teenagers today have very low self-esteem because of the media. They haven’t still found what they want to do with their lives, so, by saying mean things to them, it won’t help them be successful since they think that what they are saying is true.<br /><br />There are over 3.2 million of students that are victims of bullying each year. Because of these, approximately 160,000 teens skip school every day to avoid the bullies. Some of these students drop out of school. Some schools don’t even help the victims that are been bullied. Over two-thirds of students believe that schools respond poorly to bullying, with high percentage of students believing that adult help is infrequent and ineffective. I didn’t know that harassment and bullying has been linked to 75 percent of school-shooting incidents.<br /><br />There have been many cases of suicide because of bullying. One of the recent ones was the suicide of Amanda Todd. She committed suicide on October 10, 2012 at her home in Port Coquitlam, British Columbia, Canada.  She was 16 years old when she died. On September 7, 2012, she posted a 9-minute video on YouTube titled My Story: Struggling, bullying, suicide and self-harm, which showed her using flash cards telling her experiences being bullied.  The reason she was bullied was because when she was in 7th grade, she used video chat to meet new people over the internet. People she met would always give her complements about her looks. A stranger convinced her to bare her breasts on camera. He later blackmailed her with threats to expose the topless photo to her friends unless she gave a “show”. The photo of her circulated the internet. She moved to different places to start fresh, but the individual would always disguise himself as a student coming new to school. She tried to kill herself by drinking bleach and an overdose of drugs, but it didn’t work. Students from her school would make fun of her because she failed in her suicide and in her grades. After the entire nightmare, on October 10, 2012 at about 6:00 PM, she was found hanged at her home.<br /><br />Like I said before, most of the teenagers have a very low self-esteem and by telling them mean things, they will only become worst. Everybody makes mistakes. Kids today are always in the internet and they meet strangers everyday. As a parent, you need to pay attention to everything that the kid is doing. If you don’t want to have problems like this, don’t talk to strangers over the internet. Once it’s on the internet it stays there forever.  If you see someone that is being bullied over the internet or at school, contact an adult or confront the person yourself. If we all stand up together against bullying, the world will be a better place. You might think that the one that you are making fun of is a monster because of the stuff he or she has done, but in reality, you are the monster for making them feel worst.<br /><br />Be the change of a good person dont wait for the time that everyone leaves you<br />

                        <p>Bullying is one of the primary cases why some students get into suicide or trouble. Bullying makes us people vulnerable.

Those who are bullying must accompanied with some consequences or sanctions. We encouraged students or even the people of this society to love one another as a good citizen. We disciplined them according to the laws of this government and do not tolerate those persons who are bullying. We must be creative in implementing laws or bills about bullying. Also in the way that we must take care our people as our own child or children because we pledged to them to protect every citizen of this society. Most of those people who are bullying are the most vulnerable in all because somehow they can't feel the love in their own houses or any discipline. That is why they bullied their fellow countrymen or even classmates in school or anyone they can. We must not tolerate this kind of behavior in our country; we must discipline them according to the laws.

As a popular quotes states that, "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you".</p><p>

                            7. persuasive speech about cyber bullying </h2><br />
                        <p>I would start with some examples of individuals destroyed, driven to suicide by cyber bullying. Go straight into it; “Sally was an honors student in medicine, highly praised for her intellect and loved by her friends and family. Great things were expected of her. She might one day cure cancer… But she never will. She is dead. Cyber bullying killed her…”
</p><p>
</p><p>Don’t drag them on too long, because the idea is to pepper the audience with quick examples so they understand the issue is not with what happened to one or a few people, but that this is endemic and happens frequently. List three or four such examples, citing something that personalizes the individual to create empathy (similar to what I wrote above), the sort of attacks they were subject to using adjectives for accent, and finally the horror that resulted.
</p><p>
</p><p>Then mention statistics to show how these are not isolated incidents. Use voice inflection and dramatic pauses for emphases.
</p><p>
</p><p>Finally delve into a personal story of how it has affected you or someone close to you. This need not and likely should not be one of suicide (unless someone close to you ‘has’ been pushed that far). The emphases in this should be the emotional pain. Do what you need to do for the audience to fully appreciate the depth of it. Belabor the lasting effect this has had on you and/or your friends.
</p><p>
</p><p>At this point, your audience should be primed to hear whatever you have to say about how to address the problem. They may not agree with your proposed solutions, but they almost certainly will agree with the need that it be addressed.</p><br />

Violence has been in this world for centuries now and for the same causes, to gain power of authority. Kids in schools feel superior to others by calling other kids horrible names and making fun of them. Men hit women so they can “earn” their respect back. The point is that violence won’t make you a better person, it will make you a monster and nobody likes a monster.<br /><br /><br />

                        The cause of bullying is from people that are judgemental and insecure of others . From the people that have bad attitudes. From the people that they only want is attention. The effect of bullying is pain,depression,suicidal. Because of bullying, they are hurting enough to suicide.What is bullying? Bullying is a certain way of complimenting someone by rudeness or tragically, bullying means telling someone how you feel about them in an inappropriate way or in short term, hurting them. Taking a compliment is good they say, but what if that compliment hurts one person? That's an example of bullying. And a cause of this sudden thing is either lackness of his/her parents teaching or his/her parents taught a wrong doing. A person who had experienced this kind of doing can result to bad habits, bad manners, and even suicide as well. According to surveys of bullying, almost half of the world's population has experience bullying. And as time passes, it gets worse. As it gets worse, the effect of bullying can take away lives of thousands and maybe millions of people a day, week, month or a year. Now, a cause of bullying is dangerous but can be stopped. Though the effect of it will not result in a positive way.<br />

                        Bullying is a very popular disease among the school students today. Bullies may be specified as endangered species who make ridicule of others for their own fun. Although life is a journey and a tough fight, but, not everyone’s a fighter. Students with money power try to harm other students and cease their dignity and innocence for the entire school life. To discuss this current topic, I have divided my sample paper into 3 sections specifying the practice of bullying and how we can prevent it and save the children from facing this annoyance. Bullying means to intimidate other students (in school or college context) to do what one wants. Typically, Bullying is similar to ragging whereby group of people with high profile or superiority or seniority do pillory or scoff at the benign students. One should never do a wrong thing to make friends. Just for the sake of impressing other classmates, one should not attempt anything wrong that may harm a credulous student in anyway.<br />

Bullying has been a critical issue around schools, but before it was not as dangerous and know as it is now. These do not means bullying was not happening, it means it was not taken into consideration by parents or teachers. They thought it was just peer pressure or a kids game, and sooner or later the kids would be friends again. At one point, bullies think it’s normal to be mean and abusive to other students. They tell the victim, “I’m just messing with you” after aggression. On the other hand, the victim gives power to the bully by not speaking up and being afraid. Bullying can be avoid if the victim speaks up and seeks help from a teacher, parent, the principal, or a friend.

For example; community service, anti-bullying workshops, and school activities. Also, parents should be required to be more involved with the student academics, social life, and be responsible for their child’s behavior. By being involved in their kid’s life, this will help the bully have a better understanding of the situation, and he or she will learn how dangerous and painful is being a bully. On the other hand,  involved parents should have a better understanding as of why the student is having this behavior and will know how to help their child or seek additional help. Students will be aware of how much damage a bully may cause to the victim, and many times a bully is a victim of another bully. According to (Psychological Association) “Educate your children about bullying. It is possible that your child is having trouble reading social signs and does not know what they are doing is hurtful.

They assumed it was merely social pressure or a kid's game, and that the youngsters would be friends again sooner or later. Bullies used to believe it was acceptable to be cruel and unpleasant to other students. Following aggressiveness, they tell the victim, "I'm only joking with you."
