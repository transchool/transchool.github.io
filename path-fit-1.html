The observatory owned by Brahe was built for him by Emperor Rudolf II. 4. According to Kepler's 2nd law, the straight line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in space in equal intervals of time. 5. The law of harmony states that the square of a planet's orbital period is directly proportional to the cube of the semimajor axis of its orbit. .6. Johannes Kepler's Laws of Planetary motion consist of two laws describing the motions of planets in the solar system. 7. Kepler's data played a very substantial part in developing Brahe's laws of planetary motion. 8. Kepler's Law of Ellipses was rooted when he observed how Mar's orbit did not fit the theory that planets followed a circular path around the sun. 9. An orbit refers to a path followed by an object as it revolves around another object. 10. Kepler believed that planets revolve around the sun following a circular orbit. 11. The Earth is one of the foci identified by Kepler in his 1st law. 12. Upon Brahe's death, all his writings, instruments, and data were passed to his assistant Johannes Kepler. 13. The Rudolphine Tables is planetary table which can be used in determining the position of planets for the past 1000 years and the future 1000 years. 14. Brahe's data played a very substantial part in developing Kepler's laws of planetary motion. 15. Tycho Brahe's greatest contribution lies on the development of astronomical instruments and being able to devise a way to accurately determine the position of 777 fixed stars.​</a>

When Tycho Brahe moved to Prague to work as an imperial mathematician, King Frederick recommended the scholar Johannes Kepler to be his assistant. 3. The observatory owned by Brahe was built for him by Emperor Rudolf II. 4. According to Kepler's 2nd law, the straight line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in space in equal intervals of time. 5. The law of harmony states that the square of a planet's orbital period is directly proportional to the cube of the semimajor axis of its orbit. .6. Johannes Kepler's Laws of Planetary motion consist of two laws describing the motions of planets in the solar system. 7. Kepler's data played a very substantial part in developing Brahe's laws of planetary motion. 8. Kepler's Law of Ellipses was rooted when he observed how Mar's orbit did not fit the theory that planets followed a circular path around the sun. 9. An orbit refers to a path followed by an object as it revolves around another object. 10. Kepler believed that planets revolve around the sun following a circular orbit. 11. The Earth is one of the foci identified by Kepler in his 1st law. 12. Upon Brahe's death, all his writings, instruments, and data were passed to his assistant Johannes Kepler. 13. The Rudolphine Tables is planetary table which can be used in determining the position of planets for the past 1000 years and the future 1000 years. 14. Brahe's data played a very substantial part in developing Kepler's laws of planetary motion. 15. Tycho Brahe's greatest contribution lies on the development of astronomical instruments and being able to devise a way to accurately determine the position of 777 fixed stars.​</h2><br />
