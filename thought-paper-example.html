A huge variety of wildlife lives or breeds in the mangrove ecosystem, including numerous fish, crab and shrimp species, molluscs, and mammals like sea turtles.The forest provides a habitat for many animals. Here they find food and shelter at the same time. Each animal occupies its own space – in the crown of a tree, in shrubs and bushes or on the groundCoral reefs support more species per unit area than any other marine environment, including about 4,000 species of fish, 800 species of hard corals and hundreds of other species. Scientists estimate that there may be millions of undiscovered species of organisms living in and around reefs.</p><br />
