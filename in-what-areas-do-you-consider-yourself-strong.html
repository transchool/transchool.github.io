Why? Since I was a kid, I've already used myself at things that other people might say or think of me. But what they think doesnt fdefine who I really was so I just dont care. I dont cry easily, I hare crying cause I thought you are weak when you cry. I can get mad at you secretly, not talk to you, I can smile at you but I'm already stabbing you in the mind. Sometimes, you gotta think before you act. Sometimes, we act recklessly because we are taken by our emotions which I handle well so I wont make any hasty decisions.</p><br />

My somewhat weak is my tolerance for people that care nothing for this earth, or lack thereof. I noticed about 8 years ago that there is a lot going on right in front of our faces, but the food you eat or water, or television or music muddies the waters so to speak. A whole world of auto pilots causing the worst to happen, blind ignorance of the real world right in front of them. With the epicenter being this planet, it's a huge life, supported many avenues, bit a life none the less, and not in the form of what your thinking in plants and animals are it's life, no they are it's energy. A being so ornate and vast that we could never comprehend it. And strong points is ability to know that I don't know everything, and that every person on this planet has something to teach me. And ability to truly see every aspect of whatever situation is in front of me. It's strange actually, almost out of body and into another's just to see their point of view…..no ……feel it.</p><p></p><p>(c) Tomas Gregor (Quora)</p><br />
