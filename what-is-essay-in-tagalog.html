- An increasing problem of great concern for academic institutions is the pervasiveness of cheating among students. Further compounding this problem is advancements in technology that have created new ways for students to engage in cheating. Despite a growing interest in technology-facilitated cheating, little is known about why students may employ electronic resources to cheat. However, Akers’ social learning theory offers one plausible explanation. Surveys were collected from a sample of 534 college students at a large southeastern university in order to quantify the prevalence and frequency of Internet-facilitated cheating. These surveys allowed for an exploration of factors associated with this form of cheating and a comparison between what we refer to as E-cheating and traditional forms of cheating. Results indicate that approximately 40% of students have engaged in some form of E-cheating in the last year. Social learning variables emerge as the strongest predictors of both the occurrence and frequency of E-cheating while self-control and strain variables have little effect.
- Academic dishonesty in the online cheating environment of distance education learning has gained traction in the past decade. By a few simple keystrokes, students can find a wide array of online services for hire to write research papers, complete homework assignments, or enroll on behalf of the student on record to take the entire online course. While institutions in higher education have seen online learning as a vehicle to increase student enrollments adding to their bottom line, the number of Internet cheating companies to support academic dishonesty has also increased sustainability. Students have many options when it comes to receiving unethical assistance in the online class environment. Rowe (2010) cited three common methods students used to cheat in online courses. Students wait to take their assessment so they could get answers from others, students retook assessments based on false claims and students received unauthorized assistance during exams (Rowe, 2010). There are many more options to cheat online. Students wait for answers, claim fraudulent error messages, collusion, essay plagiarism and buying answers.
Challenges dealing with academic dishonesty in the online area have become more rampant, leaving faculty and college administrators at odds how to prevent such behavior in both traditional and online classes.
- There has been substantial research in the area of student cheating in traditional face-to-face classes but much less on cheating using technology often termed “e-cheating.” With the increased offering of online courses to provide students with greater flexibility, concerns regarding academic integrity arise. The authors have utilized a biannual survey to gather information on student cheating in both traditional and online courses. This paper summarizes the results of the authors’ surveys for the past five years. Findings show that the most common type of cheating activity reported by students is the downloading of Internet papers and representing them as the student’s own work. In addition, students report that they believe that other students cheat more on homework problems as compared to exams, term papers, and Internet projects. The most troubling finding for educators, however, is that e-cheating appears to be on the rise.</a>

                                            favor to translate this in Tagalog but by thought and not word by word (like Google ). thank you! Indeed, how heartbreaking and devasting to only hear from the word "unemployment". But what more could it be when we learn further about it? What does "unemployment" really mean? Is it just the lack of one's source of living? Or is there more to it than just that? What are the news and articles pertaining to it trying to address? What are they trying to imply? What happens to those affected by this certain issue? The people, their families, status, lifestyle, their country? And oh, the economy. A lot of questions linger in our minds, leaving us a mark on what "unemployment" really is, and how far it can go and affect us. These questions, they add up and increase; yet, they remain unanswered. Thus, the making of this essay has a major goal of fulfilling the thoughts, untiringly lingering in our minds about the true essence of "unemployment", its aspects, effects, how to cope with it, and more.​</a>

EARLY PHILIPPINE LITERATURE (an excerpt) by Dr. Lilla Quindoza-Santiago The early inhabitants of the Philippine archipelago had a native alphabet or syllabory which among the Tagalogs was called baybayin, an inscription akin to Sanskrit. It was through the baybayin that literary forms such as songs, riddles and proverbs, lyric and short poems as well as parts of epic poems were written. The bulk of these early literature however was just passed on through oral recitation and Incantation and were transcribed into the Roman alphabet only centuries later by Spanish chroniclers and other scholars. It is believed that replacement of the baybayin by the Roman alphabet must have obliterated a significant aspect of indigenous Philippine literature. 1. The excerpt above is an example of a/an... A.

More than 86 percent of the population is Roman Catholic, 6 percent belong to various nationalized Christian cults, and another 2 percent belong to well over 100 Protestant denominations. In addition to the Christian majority, there is a vigorous 4 percent Muslim minority, concentrated on the southern islands of Mindanao, Sulu, and Palawan. Scattered in isolated mountainous regions, the remaining 2 percent follow non-Western, indigenous beliefs and practices. The Chinese minority, although statistically insignificant, has been culturally influential in coloring Filipino Catholicism with many of the beliefs and practices of Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism.</p><br />

- An increasing problem of great concern for academic institutions is the pervasiveness of cheating among students. Further compounding this problem is advancements in technology that have created new ways for students to engage in cheating. Despite a growing interest in technology-facilitated cheating, little is known about why students may employ electronic resources to cheat. However, Akers’ social learning theory offers one plausible explanation. Surveys were collected from a sample of 534 college students at a large southeastern university in order to quantify the prevalence and frequency of Internet-facilitated cheating. These surveys allowed for an exploration of factors associated with this form of cheating and a comparison between what we refer to as E-cheating and traditional forms of cheating. Results indicate that approximately 40% of students have engaged in some form of E-cheating in the last year. Social learning variables emerge as the strongest predictors of both the occurrence and frequency of E-cheating while self-control and strain variables have little effect.
- Academic dishonesty in the online cheating environment of distance education learning has gained traction in the past decade. By a few simple keystrokes, students can find a wide array of online services for hire to write research papers, complete homework assignments, or enroll on behalf of the student on record to take the entire online course. While institutions in higher education have seen online learning as a vehicle to increase student enrollments adding to their bottom line, the number of Internet cheating companies to support academic dishonesty has also increased sustainability. Students have many options when it comes to receiving unethical assistance in the online class environment. Rowe (2010) cited three common methods students used to cheat in online courses. Students wait to take their assessment so they could get answers from others, students retook assessments based on false claims and students received unauthorized assistance during exams (Rowe, 2010). There are many more options to cheat online. Students wait for answers, claim fraudulent error messages, collusion, essay plagiarism and buying answers.
Challenges dealing with academic dishonesty in the online area have become more rampant, leaving faculty and college administrators at odds how to prevent such behavior in both traditional and online classes.
- There has been substantial research in the area of student cheating in traditional face-to-face classes but much less on cheating using technology often termed “e-cheating.” With the increased offering of online courses to provide students with greater flexibility, concerns regarding academic integrity arise. The authors have utilized a biannual survey to gather information on student cheating in both traditional and online courses. This paper summarizes the results of the authors’ surveys for the past five years. Findings show that the most common type of cheating activity reported by students is the downloading of Internet papers and representing them as the student’s own work. In addition, students report that they believe that other students cheat more on homework problems as compared to exams, term papers, and Internet projects. The most troubling finding for educators, however, is that e-cheating appears to be on the rise.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Ang isang pagtaas ng problema ng labis na pag-aalala para sa mga institusyong pang-akademiko ay ang paglaganap ng pandaraya sa mga mag-aaral.  Ang karagdagang pagsasama-sama sa problemang ito ay mga pagsulong sa teknolohiya na lumikha ng mga bagong paraan para sa mga mag-aaral na makisali sa pandaraya.  Sa kabila ng lumalaking interes sa pandaraya na pinadali ng teknolohiya, kaunti ang nalalaman tungkol sa kung bakit maaaring gumamit ang mga mag-aaral ng elektronikong mapagkukunan upang manloko.  Gayunpaman, nag-aalok ang teorya ng panlipunan ng pagkatuto ni Akers ng isang makatuwirang paliwanag.  Ang mga survey ay nakolekta mula sa isang sample ng 534 mga mag-aaral sa kolehiyo sa isang malaking timog-silangan na unibersidad upang masukat ang pagkalat at dalas ng pandaraya na pinadali ng Internet.  Pinapayagan ng mga survey na ito ang isang paggalugad ng mga salik na nauugnay sa ganitong uri ng pandaraya at isang paghahambing sa pagitan ng tinutukoy namin bilang E-cheating at tradisyunal na mga paraan ng pandaraya.  Ipinapahiwatig ng mga resulta na humigit-kumulang na 40% ng mga mag-aaral ang nakatuon sa ilang anyo ng E-cheating sa nakaraang taon.  Ang mga variable ng pagkatuto sa lipunan ay lumalabas bilang pinakamalakas na tagahula ng parehong paglitaw at dalas ng E-cheating habang ang mga variable ng pagpipigil sa sarili at pilay ay may maliit na epekto.</p><p></p><p> - Ang kawalan ng katapatan sa akademiko sa online na pandaraya na kapaligiran ng pag-aaral ng distansya sa edukasyon ay nakakuha ng lakas sa nakaraang dekada.  Sa pamamagitan ng ilang simpleng mga keystroke, ang mga mag-aaral ay makakahanap ng isang malawak na hanay ng mga serbisyong online para sa pag-upa upang magsulat ng mga papel sa pagsasaliksik, kumpletuhin ang takdang aralin sa bahay, o magpatala sa ngalan ng mag-aaral na naitala upang makuha ang buong kurso sa online.

- An increasing problem of great concern for academic institutions is the pervasiveness of cheating among students. Further compounding this problem is advancements in technology that have created new ways for students to engage in cheating. Despite a growing interest in technology-facilitated cheating, little is known about why students may employ electronic resources to cheat. However, Akers’ social learning theory offers one plausible explanation. Surveys were collected from a sample of 534 college students at a large southeastern university in order to quantify the prevalence and frequency of Internet-facilitated cheating. These surveys allowed for an exploration of factors associated with this form of cheating and a comparison between what we refer to as E-cheating and traditional forms of cheating. Results indicate that approximately 40% of students have engaged in some form of E-cheating in the last year. Social learning variables emerge as the strongest predictors of both the occurrence and frequency of E-cheating while self-control and strain variables have little effect.
- Academic dishonesty in the online cheating environment of distance education learning has gained traction in the past decade. By a few simple keystrokes, students can find a wide array of online services for hire to write research papers, complete homework assignments, or enroll on behalf of the student on record to take the entire online course. While institutions in higher education have seen online learning as a vehicle to increase student enrollments adding to their bottom line, the number of Internet cheating companies to support academic dishonesty has also increased sustainability. Students have many options when it comes to receiving unethical assistance in the online class environment. Rowe (2010) cited three common methods students used to cheat in online courses. Students wait to take their assessment so they could get answers from others, students retook assessments based on false claims and students received unauthorized assistance during exams (Rowe, 2010). There are many more options to cheat online. Students wait for answers, claim fraudulent error messages, collusion, essay plagiarism and buying answers.
Challenges dealing with academic dishonesty in the online area have become more rampant, leaving faculty and college administrators at odds how to prevent such behavior in both traditional and online classes.
- There has been substantial research in the area of student cheating in traditional face-to-face classes but much less on cheating using technology often termed “e-cheating.” With the increased offering of online courses to provide students with greater flexibility, concerns regarding academic integrity arise. The authors have utilized a biannual survey to gather information on student cheating in both traditional and online courses. This paper summarizes the results of the authors’ surveys for the past five years. Findings show that the most common type of cheating activity reported by students is the downloading of Internet papers and representing them as the student’s own work. In addition, students report that they believe that other students cheat more on homework problems as compared to exams, term papers, and Internet projects. The most troubling finding for educators, however, is that e-cheating appears to be on the rise.</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.)</p><p></p><p>If a war were to happen in the Philippines, it would be declared by the President of the Philippines. The President is the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, and is responsible for maintaining the national security and defending the country.</p><p></p><p>The President has the authority to declare war if the country is under attack, or if there is a threat to the sovereignty or territorial integrity of the Philippines. The President may also declare war if the country is facing an imminent danger, or when there is a need to protect Filipinos abroad. It is up to the President to determine whether or not a war should be declared, and he or she has the power to do so.</p><p></p><p>The Constitution of the Philippines also states that the Congress has the authority to declare war, provided that the declaration is approved by at least two-thirds of all the Members of the House of Representatives and of the Senate. This means that the President would need the support of the Congress should he or she decide to declare war.</p><p></p><p>It is important to note that the decision to declare war is a serious one, and it should not be taken lightly. The consequences of declaring war can be far-reaching and devastating, both for the people of the Philippines and for the country as a whole. If a war were to happen in the Philippines, the President and the Congress must consider the potential ramifications before deciding to go to war.</p><p></p><p></p><p>2.)</p><p></p><p></p><p>The military is a unique political institution and is characterized by a number of distinct features. One of the most important features of the military is its hierarchical structure. This structure is based on rank and authority, with officers and enlisted personnel occupying different positions within the chain of command. At the top of the hierarchy are the highest-ranking officers, who are responsible for making major decisions and strategy for the military. This hierarchical structure is essential for the efficient functioning of the military, as it ensures that orders are followed and that discipline is maintained.</p><p></p><p>Another important feature of the military is its non-partisan nature. The military is apolitical, meaning that it is not affiliated with any particular political party or ideology. This neutrality ensures that the military can serve to protect the nation’s interests without being influenced by partisan politics.</p><p></p><p>The military is also highly organized and disciplined. This is essential in order to ensure that it can quickly and effectively respond to threats and conflicts. The organization of the military also ensures that resources are used efficiently and that personnel are adequately trained and prepared for their roles.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the military is a professional institution. This means that military personnel are highly trained and experienced in the use of weapons and tactics. The professionalism of the military ensures that it is well-equipped to handle a wide range of tasks, from peacekeeping operations to combat operations.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the military is a unique political institution that is characterized by its hierarchical structure, non-partisan nature, organization and discipline, and professionalism. These features ensure that the military remains an effective tool for protecting the nation’s interests.</p><br />

                        <p>Ang grupo ng LGBTQ ay nag nabuo dahil sa kanilang adbokasiya na ipag laban ang kanilang </p><p>karapatan at kahalagahan sa mundo. ngunit sari-sari ang mga opinyon patungkol dito, madami na na tumututol dahil narin sa paniniwala sa ating panginoon at sa isanasaad ng bibliya na " Ang babae ay para sa lalake at ang lalake naman ay para sa babae" dahil kasalanan sa ating Diyos kung ikaw ay makiki apid sa kapwa mo kasarian dahil ito ay alam nating masama at pinag babawal bagamat maraming tumutol madami pa din naman na pinag lalaban nilang tama ito at payag at suportado nila ang LGBTQ dahil ang kanilang iniisip ay lahat tayo ay may karapatang mamili ng gusto kaya bigyan natin ng karapatan ang bawat isa sa atin na mamili kung ano ba talaga ang sinisigaw ng kanilang puso at isipan. Ang aking opinyon naman patungkol dito ay sa aking palagay ay masama pa din na ipag patuloy natin ito dahil kung talagang naniniwala at mahal nating ang Diyos nararapat lang Hindi tayo gumawa ng mga bagay na alam nating tayo ay mag kakasala, ngunit kung hindi naman ganon ka sobra ang ginagawa ng taong yun dapat lang natin syang hayaan at payuhan tungkol sa bagay na yan at paubti unti nyang matutunan na hindi dapat ginagawa ang mga bagay na ganon ng dahil lang sa nakikita natin sa iba at dahil yan ang uso. Sa kabuuan matuto tayong makontento sa kung anong meron at kung ano tayo na binigay sa ating Diyos hindi masamang gawin ang mga gusto natin pero dapat alamin pa din natin ang ating mga limitasyon.</p><br />

EARLY PHILIPPINE LITERATURE (an excerpt) by Dr. Lilla Quindoza-Santiago The early inhabitants of the Philippine archipelago had a native alphabet or syllabory which among the Tagalogs was called baybayin, an inscription akin to Sanskrit. It was through the baybayin that literary forms such as songs, riddles and proverbs, lyric and short poems as well as parts of epic poems were written. The bulk of these early literature however was just passed on through oral recitation and Incantation and were transcribed into the Roman alphabet only centuries later by Spanish chroniclers and other scholars.
