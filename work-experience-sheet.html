                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My experience during modular learning is kinda hard. It is because I only do self study which I don't know how to start. Sometimes I get help from mama or papa. They explain me some so I can understand. Eventually I learned how to manage my studies. I watched YouTube videos for explanation of my lessons so I can learn more. Thanks to the modern technologies, it makes my studies more efficient. I do my modules very well too. I hope this will end soon because I already miss school learning.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:Understand the Situation</strong></p><p><strong>Take some time to think about the situation you're facing. Try to describe your situation in a sentence or two. What's stressful about this situation for you right now? It can help to write down your thoughts.</strong></p><p><strong>For example: My family just moved, so I switched to a new school in the middle of the year. The stressful parts are not knowing anyone, missing my old friends, and dealing with all new schoolwork.</strong></p><p><strong>Notice and name the feelings you have about the situation. Accept your feelings — it's understandable to feel the way you feel, given your situation. It can help to write down your feelings, too.</strong></p><p><strong>For example: I feel lonely and sad because of missing old friends and my old school. I'm mad that we had to move, especially now. I'm worried about keeping up in math and social studies. I feel left out because I'm the new kid. I guess anyone would feel this way if they were in my situation.</strong></p><p><strong>Learn more. Learn all you can about the situation you're dealing with. This might include reading about it, talking to others, or finding out what others in your situation have done and what to expect. Learning helps you feel more confident and prepared — plus it reminds you that you're not the only one who has gone through this.</strong></p><p></p><br />
