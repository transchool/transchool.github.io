                        <p><strong>Answer: José Rizal</strong></p><p><strong>Philippine National Hero and Ophthalmologist</strong></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong></p><p><strong>José Rizal (1861-1896) is one of the most revered figures in Philippine history. He was a multifaceted intellectual and a political activist, best known for his political writings that inspired the Philippine revolution and ultimately led to his execution by the Spanish colonizers. Rizal was also a physician who trained in ophthalmology under 2 prominent European ophthalmologists, Louis de Wecker and Otto Becker.</strong></p><p><strong>Rizal has become a symbol of the Philippine struggle for independence, and he is known there as a national hero. December 30, the date of Rizal's execution in 1896, is celebrated as a national holiday in the Philippines. Jose Rizal College was dedicated to his honor in Manila in 1919. There are commemorative monuments to Rizal in Manila near the site of his execution in Luneta Park, in his hometown, and most Filipino towns, in Heidelberg, and Chicago. His portrait appears on the Filipino 2-peso bill. The region around Manila, including his hometown of Calamba, was designated a province and named Rizal. His novels are required reading for Filipino high school students. Jose Rizal can perhaps be best summarized using his own words from the poem he wrote from his cell the night before his execution. One of the last stanzas of "Ultimo Adios" (Final Farewell) shows his selfless devotion to his country, his loyalty to his family, his deep spirituality despite criticism of the church, and his artistic grace.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As we honor today the 118th death anniversary of the Philippines’ foremost national hero, Dr. Jose P. Rizal, let me dwell on one of his favorite subjects: the youth. “Where are the youth who will consecrate their golden hours, their illusions, and their enthusiasm to the welfare of their native land?” Rizal asked as he wrote in his novel El Filibusterismo more than a century ago. But amid such words uttered through one of the novel’s characters, Padre Florentino, Rizal expressed his love and admiration for the youth whom he called “bella esperanza de la patria (fair hope of the fatherland) in his poem, “A la Juventud Filipina (To the Filipino Youth).” Just as Rizal believed in the youth’s potential for nation-building in the 19th century, so did President Aquino acknowledged just recently the power of young people to be agents of positive change. “The youth in general is a primary motive force for change in society. When you are older, when you have certain sets of responsibilities, then you tend to compromise some of the principles or the beliefs that you had when you were younger. The young, therefore, are the main means to rekindle these principles,” President Aquino told members of the Kristiyanong Kabataan para sa Bayan, youth arm of the Jesus is Lord Church, during its 10th anniversary rites last December 19. “The experience of the older set and the strength, resilience and energy of the youthful set combined … becomes a necessary component to effect changes right away,” President Aquino added even as reminded young people that there is more to life than taking selfies and playing electronic games. “Of course, it is up to you how you want to use the technology available now. But do not forget to be astute… Not because something is viral or trending, we should spend time on it,” he said in the forum two weeks ago. And about two years ago, in a talk with students during the “Youth for IT 2012 program” at University of the Philippines, I expressed similar thoughts: The youth should be able to look at information technology and social media not just for trivia and play, but as potentially powerful tools capable of reaching millions of people, influencing them with ideals, and mobilizing them to act together to change for the better the life of a nation. The youth can indeed change the quality of life of our nation. They can establish an effective and honest government. They can choose God-fearing, competent and compassionate leaders who will create jobs and livelihood for the people and bail out the country from poverty, underdevelopment, injustice, inequality, and breakdown in peace and order. History is replete with examples of young people who sacrificed their lives to achieve freedom and fight oppression. Rizal, along with Andres Bonifacio, Apolinario Mabini, Emilio Jacinto, Gregorio del Pilar, and many others shined during the Spanish era. Macario Sakay and Miguel Malvar defied American occupation. Countless young Filipinos fought Japanese invaders during World War II. And my generation, the youth of the 70s and the 80s, set aside their comfort and safety to resist the martial law regime. Youth empowerment is a must for every generation of history. Our fathers and those before them acted in their youth to harness the technology of their time to become empowered and make a difference in the life of the nation. And in pursuit of such empowerment, the Order of the Knights of Rizal—for which I had served as its Supreme Commander in 2006—is tasked to train and develop the youth in character building, citizenship training, democratic leadership, patriotism, universal brotherhood, and dedicated service to God, country and people. It also is tasked, among others, to study and spread the ideals, teachings and exemplary life of Rizal and exhort them to emulate and practice the examples set by our national hero. The youth is the largest sector of our society, with hardly any vested interest to protect, with time on their side, and with talent and treasure to develop and grow. When fully mobilized, enlightened, motivated, and inspired, the youth sector is the biggest single block of citizens that can change Philippine society. Indeed, as prophesized by Rizal, the youth is the hope of the fatherland.

</strong></p><p><strong>05. Dr. Jose Rizal​ </strong></p><p><strong>Answer: noun</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>A noun is a word that functions as the name of a specific object or set of objects, such as living creatures, places, actions, qualities, states of existence, or ideas. However, noun is not a semantic category, so it cannot be characterized in terms of its meaning.</p><p></p><p><strong>Proper nouns vs. common nouns</strong>
</p><p>One important distinction to be made is whether a noun is a proper noun or a common noun. A proper noun is a specific name of a person, place, or thing, and is always capitalized.
</p><p>
</p><p>Does Tina have much homework to do this evening?
</p><p>Tina is the name of a specific person.
</p><p>
</p><p>I would like to visit Old Faithful.
</p><p>Old Faithful is the specific name of a geological phenomenon.
</p><p>
</p><p>The opposite of a proper noun is a common noun, sometimes known as a generic noun. A common noun is the generic name of an item in a class or group and is not capitalized unless appearing at the beginning of a sentence or in a title.
</p><p>
</p><p>The girl crossed the river.
</p><p>Girl is a common noun; we do not learn the identity of the girl by reading this sentence, though we know the action she takes. River is also a common noun in this sentence.</p><p></p><p>#BRAINLYFAST!</p><br />
