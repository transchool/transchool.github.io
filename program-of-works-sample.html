A large newspaper wants to estimate the proportion of newspaper printed that have a nonconforming attribute, such as excessive ruboft, improper page setup, missing pages, or duplicate pages. A random sample of 200 newspapers is selected from all the newspapers printed during a single day For this sample of 200,35 contain some type of nonconformance. Construct and interpret a 90% confidence interval for the proportion of newspapers printed during the day that have a nonconforming attribute 2. The telephone company wants to estimate the proportion of households that would purchase an additional telephone line if it were made available at a substantially reduced installation cost. A random sample of 500 households is selected. The results indicate that 135 of the households would purchase the additional telephone line at a reduced installation cost. a. Construct a 99% confidence interval estimate of the population proportion of households that would purchase the additional telephone line b. How would the manager in charge of promotional programs concerning residential customers use the results in (a)? 3.

                            14. ACTIVITY 23. Solve the following problems. Provide the given and show your complete solution. 1. A large newspaper wants to estimate the proportion of newspaper printed that have a nonconforming attribute, such as excessive ruboft, improper page setup, missing pages, or duplicate pages. A random sample of 200 newspapers is selected from all the newspapers printed during a single day For this sample of 200,35 contain some type of nonconformance. Construct and interpret a 90% confidence interval for the proportion of newspapers printed during the day that have a nonconforming attribute 2. The telephone company wants to estimate the proportion of households that would purchase an additional telephone line if it were made available at a substantially reduced installation cost. A random sample of 500 households is selected. The results indicate that 135 of the households would purchase the additional telephone line at a reduced installation cost. a. Construct a 99% confidence interval estimate of the population proportion of households that would purchase the additional telephone line b. How would the manager in charge of promotional programs concerning residential customers use the results in (a)? 3. Millions of Americans arrange travel plans on the Web ('Travelers Head Online", USA Today Snapshots, July 22, 2003). A recent survey reported that 77% purchase plane tickets on the Web. Suppose the survey was based on 1000 respondents. a. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the population proportion of Americans who purchase plane tickets on the Web. b. Construct a 99% confidence interval for the population proportion of Americans who purchase plane tickets on the Web c. Which interval is wider ? Explain why this is true. 4. A survey of working women in North America was conducted by the Clinique unit of Estee Lauder Cosmetics. Of the 1000 women surveyed, 55% believed that companies should hold positions for those on maternity leave for six months or less, and 45% felt that they should hold positions for more than six months ('Work Week", The Wall Street Journal, September 11,2001,A1) a. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of all working women in North America who believe that companies should hold positions for those on maternity leave for more than six months. b. Interpret the interval constructed in (a).5. A researcher would like to determine the proportion of students in a university who did not vote during the student elections. He found out that out of his 80 respondents, 22 did not vote. a. With a confidence level of 90%, determine the confidence interval estimate of the proportion of students who did not vote. b. with a confidence level of 95%, determine the confidence interval estimate of the proportion of students who did not vote.help po pls and answer po sa solution 1 to 5​</h2><br />
