It is the inspiration of thefamily and an inviolable social institution.The Family Code of the Philippines sets eighteen (18) as the age ofmaturity of the Filipinos. However, for marriages between the age of 18 to 21,the written consent of the parent is required. Without the written consent,the marriage is voidable.A person who is between the ages 21-25 is obliged to ask their parentsor guardian for advice and has got to make a sworn statement that advicewas sought and given. If there's no parental advice or if the advice isunfavorable, the wedding license is issued only after three months after thepublication of the appliance for the license.The marriage of persons who are below 18 years of aged is void (notlawful, not legal) and thus, no true marriage happened.what is the republic act all about ​</a>

                            7. what advice you can give to those teenagers who engage in early dating and marriage.​</h2><br />
                        <p></p><strong>1. Share your own stories.</strong>First, think about the message you want to pass on to your teenager and pick a story from your past about an experience with dating and relationships that will set the tone for the conversation. When a parent shares his or her story, it starts a conversation and creates a dialogue, as opposed to coming off as a lecture.<p></p><strong>2. Convey your values and beliefs.</strong>Next, think about what values and beliefs do you want to pass on to your teenager? This is a tricky thing, as he may not agree with you. Open yourself up and allow for opinions to be expressed. Having an open mind will be more conducive to your relationship and to the conversations to follow. While it’s okay to disagree, trying to get your point across with force, shame, or fear will cause your teenager to withdraw. You’ll want to keep this conversation going. Using a lot of “what-if” scenarios will help illustrate your point of view.<p></p><strong>3. Coach them on appropriate behavior.</strong>Remember teaching your toddler her manners? Teaching teens about dating and relationship “etiquette” is no different. The foundation of all interaction is built on kindness and respect. More “what-if” scenarios can help your teen understand how to approach new situations. Additionally, your culture or religion might have certain customs you’d like to pass on.<p></p><strong>4. Reinforce the importance of clear communication.</strong>Finally, how to communicate. Lack of communication can cause serious problems in dating and teenage relationships. Your teenager must understand the importance of knowing what is acceptable or not in terms of how he wants people to treat him and how he will treat others. How and what to communicate to his partner will be a life-long learning process.<br />

                            8. what advice you can give to those teenagers who engage in early dating and marriage?​</h2><br />
                        <p>The advice I can give to those teenagers who engage in early dating and marriage is to be responsible. What I mean about being responsible is to take responsibility with all the actions that they will be taking in the relationship and to take things seriously. Dating and marriage are both serious things which should not be done just because you feel pressured with your peers or because you think it is a trend. Being in a relationship, especially entering the marriage thing is a huge responsibility as mature decisions should be made and there are more persons going to be a part of your relationship.</p><p></p><p><strong>#BRAINLYEVERYDAY</strong></p><br />

Some choose the sincere route, offering words that only come with years of experience and wisdom, while others are blunt with no sugar coating because, inarguably, that's how life is.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The good news is that the authoritative parenting style is typically identified as the best approach to parenting. Kids who grow up with authoritative parents tend to be more self-regulated and independent as they grow older. Authoritative parents also tend to raise happier and more successful children.</p><br />

                            30. How did your parents sustain their marriage</h2><br />
                        <p>Answer:
</p><p>
</p><p>Listen to one another.
</p><p>
</p><p>Explanation:
</p><p>
</p><p>It would be a problem if one's parent does't love each other. But if your parents do love each other, it won't be hard for me to explain it.
</p><p>
</p><p>When one of them have a problem, then other one should listen. Listening to one's problem can really help because for example, "Your wife has a problem. As her husband, you should listen and try to comfort her. So, when your the one who has problems, she'll also listen to you just like how you listened to her." If one of you are wrong, don't be rude and especially, don't blab at your partner. You should carefully tell her on how to fix the problem. In that way, she'll feel much better and also relieved that she has released her anger in a peaceful way.</p><br />
