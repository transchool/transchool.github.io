SONG A
This _______ will never be what I expected
And if I don't ________
Who would have guessed it?
I will not leave alone
____________ that I own
To make you feel like it's not too ____________
It's ____________ too late
Even if I say
It'll be alright
Still I _________ you say
You want to end your life
Now and again we try
To just stay alive
Maybe we'll turn it all ________
'Cause it's not too late
It's never too late
No one will ever see
This side reflected
And if there's something _________
Who would have guessed it?
And I have left alone
Everything that I _________
To make you ___________ like
It's not too late
It's never too late
Even if I say
It'll be alright
Still I ________ you say
You want to end your _________
Now and _________ we try
To just stay ____________
Maybe ____________ turn it all around
'Cause it's not too late
It's never too late
The world we _______
Won't come back
The _______ we've _______
Can't get it back
The life we had
Won't be ______ again
This world will never be
What I expected
And if I don't belong
Even if I say
It'll be _____________.
Still I hear you say
You want to end your life.
Now and again we try
To just stay alive
Maybe we'll turn it around
'Cause it's not too late
It's never too late
Maybe we'll turn it around
'Cause it's not too late
It's never too late (It's never too late)
It's not too late
It's never too late

                                            Filipinos are naturally talented. Whenever there is a nationwide competition,
each city never loses an entry that will represent its unique and rich heritage,
cultures, and traditions. As an individual, it feels satisfying to see one's own fellow
Filipino in the same locality excels. Are you proud of your own city? How well do you

SONG A
This _______ will never be what I expected
And if I don't ________
Who would have guessed it?
I will not leave alone
____________ that I own
To make you feel like it's not too ____________
It's ____________ too late
Even if I say
It'll be alright
Still I _________ you say
You want to end your life
Now and again we try
To just stay alive
Maybe we'll turn it all ________
'Cause it's not too late
It's never too late
No one will ever see
This side reflected
And if there's something _________
Who would have guessed it?
And I have left alone
Everything that I _________
To make you ___________ like
It's not too late
It's never too late
Even if I say
It'll be alright
Still I ________ you say
You want to end your _________
Now and _________ we try
To just stay ____________
Maybe ____________ turn it all around
'Cause it's not too late
It's never too late
The world we _______
Won't come back
The _______ we've _______
Can't get it back
The life we had
Won't be ______ again
This world will never be
What I expected
And if I don't belong
Even if I say
It'll be _____________.
Still I hear you say
You want to end your life.
Now and again we try
To just stay alive
Maybe we'll turn it around
'Cause it's not too late
It's never too late
Maybe we'll turn it around
'Cause it's not too late
It's never too late (It's never too late)
It's not too late
It's never too late
