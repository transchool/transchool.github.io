The Panday's tools may not be flashy or powerful, but they are a symbol of the people's power and potential.</p><p></p><p>10 In the present time, an object or symbol that can be used as a weapon is the "pen" this symbol can be used as a weapon of resistance against oppression and censorship. Just as the Panday used his tools to resist oppression and fight for freedom, a pen can be used to resist censorship and oppression through writing and self-expression.</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>the answer in the top is correct sorry i need points ty </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>"I do" by Eileen R. Tabios</strong></p><p><strong>a poem analysis (Part 1)</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>When we first observe the way that the poem portrays, it indicates that there is someone speaking, in which it is a woman who has the ability to speak English. However, it indicates that whenever you speak English, it doesn’t mean that you are as the “level” as someone else. The English Language is considered as the universal spoken language in the world. That means, a lot of educational institutions reinforce the English Language as part of the curriculum. While a lot of people can speak English, there is still a difference of having the same language as the mother tongue and the learned language and it is really based on your ethnicity.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>I do know English and, therefore, when hungry, can ask for more than minimum wage, pointing repeatedly at my mouth and yours.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>I think this line meant of all of the people who can speak English and at the same time, do work for other nations because they aren’t really contented and they can’t sustain their families in their own country. One good example is Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW’s) who decided to take a risk to make their families better. While this may be noble job but seeing this last phrase has a really suggestive meaning. It expresses the act of kissing one another.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>I shall call you “Master” with a lack of irony; lift my cotton blouse; cup my breasts to offer them to your eyes, your lips, your tongue; keen at the moon hiding at 11 a.m. to surface left tendon on my neck. For your teeth. And so on.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>No need to decipher your response—and if you wish, go ahead: spank me.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>I can remind you of the rose petals I mailed to you after releasing them from the padded cell between my thighs.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>These lines express an act of a woman of having a sexual intercourse in a literal context, but when we are going to describe it into a more different thought about the ones who can speak English, it could mean that other people who can speak English as they are being demoralized and deprived like being deflowered (in a way that removing a person’s purity rises us on a stereotype on the society that he or she is an outcast). It is not just woman who is involved on such prejudice and discrimination but below is this line that finally opens up what that woman really points out into the poem.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Part 2 of my analysis is on the Brainly Link below:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>brainly.ph/question/12953424</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />
