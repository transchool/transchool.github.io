In the first essay, I employ formal modeling and use natural experiment to examine how politician behavior impact governance. In the last two essays, I use randomized field experiments to evaluate policy interventions that strengthen the ability of voters to hold politicians accountable and attract a more qualified pool of candidates to public office.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It is an essay so it is usually long</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Early polities in what is now the Philippines were small entities known as barangays, although some larger states were established following the arrival of Hinduism and Islam through regional trade networks. The arrival of Spanish settlers began a period of Spanish expansion which led to the creation of the Captaincy General of the Philippines, governed out of Manila. While technically part of New Spain, the Philippines functioned mostly autonomously. The reliance on native leaders to help govern led to the creation of an elite class known as the principalia. Spanish control was never firmly established over much of its claimed territory, with some inland and Islamic regions remaining effectively independent.
</p><p>
</p><p>The 19th century saw a significant social change, and the development of a distinct Filipino identity among the mestizo elite. Members of the educated Ilustrado class, influenced by liberal ideas, launched the Propaganda Movement. Rejection by Spanish authorities led to a national awakening, the emergence of an independence movement, and a revolution which became entwined with the Spanish–American War. While the revolutionaries declared independence, Spain ceded the Philippines to the United States in 1898. Through the subsequent Philippine–American War and later actions, the United States established effective administration over the entire archipelago and introduced political structures that reflected those of the United States.</p><br />

Culture, Organization, and Politics are all interconnected, and we must begin at the beginning to understand them. Culture is an observable social phenomenon. From a societal standpoint, culture is comprised of attire, food, language, art, architecture, music, and history. People, their cultures, and politics are all examples of the society. When cultural concerns are discussed in public, they are determined by how society perceives them. When it comes to political concerns, economics, law, and governance determine society. Politics is the path that society takes, led by its culture, to determine its fate in terms of freedom, liberty, and rights.</p><p></p><p>#CarryonLearning</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The politics of the Philippines take place in an organized framework of a presidential, representative, and democratic republic whereby the president is both the head of state and the head of government within a pluriform multi-party system. This system revolves around three separate and sovereign yet interdependent branches: the legislative branch, the executive branch, and the judicial branch. Executive power is exercised by the government under the leadership of the president. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the bicameral Congress: the Senate (the upper house) and the House of Representatives (the lower house). Judicial power is vested in the courts with the Supreme Court of the Philippines as the highest judicial body.
</p><p>
</p><p>Elections are administered by an independent Commission on Elections every three years starting 1992. Held every second Monday of May, the winners in the elections take office on the following June 30.</p><p>Local government is produced by local government units from the provinces, cities, municipalities, and barangays. While most regions do not have political power and exist merely for administration purposes, autonomous regions have expanded powers more than the other local government units. While local government units enjoy autonomy, much of their budget is derived from allocations from the national government, putting their true autonomy in doubt.</p><p>Executive power is vested to the President.The president, who is both the head of state and head of government,is directly elected to a single six-year term via first past the post.Presidents are limited to a single consecutive term.</p><p>The Vice President, limited to two consecutive single six-year terms, is elected separately from the president.This means the President and Vice President may be from different political parties.While the vice president has no constitutional powers aside from acting as president when the latter is unable to do so, the president may give the former a cabinet office. In case of death, resignation, or incapacitation, of the President, the Vice President becomes the president until the expiration of the term.The Vice President may also serve as Acting President if the President is temporarily incapacitated.</p><p>
Executive power is exercised through the Cabinet,who are appointed by the President. While the appointees may wield executive power, all powers and responsibilities ultimately remain with the President, who may overrule any decision made by a cabinet member. Cabinet includes the heads of executive departments. Actions taken by executive and administrative officials are taken as actions exercized by the President.Cabinet members may not be members of Congress. Close relatives of the President are explicitly barred from certain offices.</p><p>The president is also the commander in chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines,thereby ensuring civilian supremacy over the military. The president is also given several military powers, although this automatically ends after 60 days unless extended by Congress,and it can be reviewed by the Supreme Court. The president also proposes a national budget, which Congress may adopt in full, with amendments, or a complete revision altogether.</p><p>
</p><p>The president wields considerable political power,and has considerable influence over supposedly independent agencies due to the power of appointment.The President directly controlled the Philippine Development Assistance Fund until the Supreme Court declared this unconstitutional in 2013. Following this, the Disbursement Acceleration Program was created to allow the President to direct funds, although some parts of this new program have similarly been declared unconstitutional. Such influence means that the legislature has never overcome a Presidential veto, despite having the theoretical power to do so. A commission on appointments, independent from the legislature but made up of members from it, has the power to veto Presidential appointments. However, court rulings mean the President can renominate an individual repeatedly upon rejection, and that that individual can effectively carry out the role by being officially in an acting capacity.The strength of the Presidency combined with weak state institutions exacerbates corruption in the country.</p><p>
</p><p>Under the 1987 constitution, the House of Representatives has the power to impeach the President through a vote of one-third of its members, and the Senate decides upon the case. Impeachment proceedings against an individual can not occur more than once per year, which can be abused through the filing cases with weak impeachment claims to forestall the filing of stronger cases. President Joseph Estrada was the first Asian head of state to be tried following impeachment, although he was not ousted by the Senate. No President has ever been ousted through impeachment.</p>hope it helps#carryonlearning
