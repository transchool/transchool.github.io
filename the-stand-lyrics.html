Everyone is excited to be part of the contest, having only one choice of song that all are familiar yet seems so unfamiliar. A singing contest without a juror to judge the voice quality. However, when people heard the song, whatever they are doing, and whenever they are, they will pause for a moment and encouraged a standing ovation. The sound that gains our respect and always a special guest in important occasions. All are aware on the scripted speech. One song that unitë every Filipino though we mispronounced the words, maltreated the melody.rumbled the lyrics and people tend to sing it with laziness. But the good news is, it never leaves us nor forsakes us. It gives us identity and pride among nations. Some says that there's no forever. Yes, but this mysterious song that we have taken for granted is always with us now and forever. The song is familiar, yet we really don't know the title, finally the host signals the start of the show" Bayang magiliw, ready sing."​</a>

How to be brave?
How can I love when I'm afraid to fall?
But watching you stand alone
All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow
One step closer
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
Time stands still
Beauty in all she is
I will be brave
I will not let anything take away
What's standing in front of me
Every breath
Every hour has come to this
One step closer
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
One step closer
One step closer
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years

And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

Colors and promises
How to be brave?
How can I love when I'm afraid to fall?
But watching you stand alone
All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow
One step closer
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
Time stands still
Beauty in all she is
I will be brave
I will not let anything take away
What's standing in front of me
Every breath
Every hour has come to this
One step closer
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
One step closer
One step closer
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

                            30. II. Directions: Read the poem: "To Helen " by Edgar Allan Poe and answer thequestions that follow.To HelenBY EDGAR ALLAN POEHelen, thy beauty is to meLike those Nicéan barks of yore,That gently, o'er a perfumed sea,The weary, way-worn wanderer boreTo his own native shore.On desperate seas long wont to roam,Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face,Thy Naiad airs have brought me homeTo the glory that was Greece,And the grandeur that was Rome.Lo! in yon brilliant window-nicheHow statue-like I see thee stand,The agate lamp within thy hand!Ah, Psyche, from the regions whichAre Holy-Land!1.Identify and write the line in the poem where the author makescomparison with flowers?2.Who do you think is the wanderer in the last two lines of the first stanza?3.What does the author trying to imply in these lines:Lo! in yon brilliant window-nicheLow statue-like I see thee stand,4.What is the tone of the poem as expressed by the author?5.Was the life of the author shown in the poem? In what way?6."To Helen" is a lyric poem extolling the beauty of a woman.Is this type ofexpressions still exist in our modern times? Why do you say so?please need kopo ng answer​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.	Identify and write the line in the poem where the author makes
</p><p>comparison with flowers?
</p><p>
</p><p>Answer:  Helen, thy beauty is to me  </p><p>Like those Nice'an barks of yore,
</p><p>-This line is like flowers whenever you see it, its makes beauty and nice to your eyes.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2.Who do you think is the wanderer in the last two lines of the first stanza?
</p><p>Answer: It’s Helen.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>3.What does the author trying to imply in these lines:
</p><p>Lo! in yon brilliant window-niche
</p><p>Low statue-like I see thee stand,
</p><p>
</p><p>•	Answer: The speaker is floored by Helen's beauty as he sees her standing in the "window niche" (like a nook). Saying "Lo" is like saying OMG when you all of a sudden see something astonishing. Helen is standing "statue-like," which means both that she resembles a work of art and that she is not moving at all.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>4.What is the tone of the poem as expressed by the author?
</p><p>Answer: The tone of the poem is written in admiration in a heavenly and dreamy language towards the stellar features of the legendary Helen of Troy set in the picturesque ancient Greek where various aspects of creativity and theory developed. It also shows the underlying love Poe has for his first lady, Jane Stanard.
</p><p>
</p><p>5.Was the life of the author shown in the poem? In what way?
</p><p>Answer: Yes, it has shown there through his stanzas you could tell how he described Helen and how their lives together as well as his life being with Helen.
