                                            Essay A (Argumentative Essay) Essay B (Inform GRADING by Remzi Yavuz As students we all have been challenged to do our best Throughout our lives we have been labeled with our grades; in high school, the ones with low grades were left alone in misery, while the ones with higher grades were praised as the leaders of this horse race. Then, the question that comes into mind is: is it right to categorize students, does grading contribute to education? It is assumed and stated in the philosophy of the current educational system that grading encourages learning and without it students would not study That is far from being true and also expresses another flaw of our education system The system is based on fear the basic motive for students to study is fear of low grades. Furthermore, because the grades are the main criteria for passing courses, students do not study they just develop methods of cheating. Thus, without learning the subject, they keep passing Since grades received in exams are more important than learning the subject matter, all students have to do to pass their courses is memonizing how a specific problem is solved. Without knowing why such a method is used, students cannot apply their ability to solve the problem to daily life. However, they pass exams without learning why, how or what of the matter Another disadvantage of grading is that grades of a student are not updated and will have a great impact in the long run. Apart from these problems, which can be virtually solved by optimizing and improving the grading system, the most important defect of the system cannot be repaired without changing the whole systern. The grading system causes inequalities, superior-inferior relations, classifications, and even conflicts It may be maintained that societies of the modern world are structured on these basic principles, but the fact that something exists does not justify it. Moreover, the people grown up in such an education system will not be able to see the other side of the walls, or will be afraid even to take a glimpse. To sum up, grading students is not a good practice and should be abolished. It is clear that education, especially education during childhood, has a great effect on one's life. And if you bring the children up in conditions of conflict and competition, they will look for conflicts in the future too​</a>

All these things that we find in our surroundings and all the natural phenomena that our country experiences such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are not due to some luck or accident. In Grade 7, you learned to describe the characteristics of our environment and the location of our country using a coordinate system, nearby continents and bodies of water, earth's materials that people use as main sources which are taken from volcanoes. In this module, we shall try to answer these two questions: 1) Why do earthquakes occur? 2) What is the relationship between earthquakes and faults? pa answer please​</a>

                                            Who won this year’s 7th grade race around the campus? 
Every year at Xavier School for Gifted Youngster, there is an all-class race. Below are the results for the 7th grade (which is made up of four different classes of 7th grade). But there is a problem: no one agrees on who won! One person thinks Class C should win the trophy because they had the 1st runner overall in the race. Another person thinks Class D should win because they had 3 runners come in under 10th place. A third person says: just find the average. But a 4th person said: wait a minute – D Class had way more students in their class than Class C! Averages won’t be fair. A 5th person says: use the scoring system in Cross Country – just add up the place of finish of the top 5 and lowest total wins. A 6th person says – unfair! Some classes did well in the first few runners but poorly in the middle! Why should they win? Now, everyone is confused and arguing. 
What is the most fair solution? Who should win the trophy? Your group, well-known in the school as a group of expert mathematicians (and widely known and respected for your sense of fairness) is being consulted as to who should win the trophy. What will you recommend and why?</a>

                                            Example ScenarioThe College of Information Technology and Computer Studies has a large numberof student population in the university. Managing an IT student and bringing togetherdepartments and other colleges to achieve the mission is always a big challenge for theThe management. Most are transferees, irregular students and with failed subjectaffected in this situation because they need to provide a copy of grades during advisingperiod and manually write it on the evaluation checklist to monitor their performancegrade in every semester before processing the enrolment.The college coordinators who have an access to verify, update and monitoring thestudent checklists. This checklist is used to back-up the Microsoft Access database thatuses to record the advising record. During the enrolment, the coordinators runs a reportthat will print out the evaluation checklist for the day. Not only does to maintain theevaluation database, but it also uses a copy of grades to validate the grade of the student.Although the MIS enrolment system supports the student viewing of gradesinformation, the Coordinators has noticed some drawbacks. On particular situation the evaluation for the courses have conflicted with missing subject to enrol due toCurriculum used by the student and will cause to failure of completion to the courseprogram. CITCS will like to get information about the automatic assessment of thestudent evaluation of grades per semester. They have been talking about either updating the system or replacing it with a newinformation system that would meet the current and future needs but needs more detailson which option is feasible for the advising procedures. Your tasks is to help come upwith a plan to address these issues.Project AnalysisWrite one-page review and observation in the CITCS Advisingprocedures for enrolment with the intent of improving it through standardmethodology. For this study, provide some discretion as to how would like tostructure the presentation and must address the following requirements abouteach step in the systems analysis design process: a. Planning: Define the scope of the problem.b. Requirements: Justify the functional requirements. Explain what documentation will be used to analyze the needs of the end users to ensure the new system can meet their expectations?c. Design: Use the information that you received from the system requirement documentation to explain how you will design the new or updated system. What are the necessary specifications and operations of the user interface that will meet the functional requirements? Will you use a Flowchart or any presentation diagram.</a>

According to Fabre (2015), increasing the performance level among the students is common goa as teacher. With this, Interactive Science Notebook (ISN) is an intervention used to increase siudents' performance and interest in learning Science. This study focused on the Grade 9 Frucality students who failed in science subject based on their perfomance task A pretest and posttest were conducted to find out the relatic nship of students learning in science with the help of the Interactive Science Notebook (ISN) as an intervention. Results revealed that the performance task of the students increases as well as their final grades. This is because students leam more if they participate directly in the class performance and gain deeper leaming. When the students are motivated to participate more, there is a great possibility that the written works and quarterly assessment in the grading system will increase significantly. ​</a>

Tabako University is using a computer system where faculty members are required to personally encode the grades of students, print the grade sheet and submit the signed grade sheet to the department secretary. The department secretary will then submit the grade sheet to the department’s Chair concerned for signature before submitting the hardcopy to the Registrar’s office. Even if the grade sheets are not printed, the same is stored in the computer system and a student concerned will have his grade in the transcript of his records. The printed grade sheet is just a back-up copy of the computer system in case of a system failure.On March 21, 2020 all the grade sheets were already submitted by all CS instructors to Ms. Jane. However, Jane could not submit the same to the registrar’s office because the grade sheet were NOT signed by Mr. Person who attended an intensive Java Boot Camp Seminar being held in Mindanao. Without the knowledge of Mr. Person, Ms. Jane forged the signature of Mr. Person and personally signed on the grade sheet. Jane told herself, “if I will NOT do it, we will be late in the submission of grade sheets, anyway Sir Jay’s signature is only a formal requirement.”​</a>

                            3. Essay A (Argumentative Essay) Essay B (Inform GRADING by Remzi Yavuz As students we all have been challenged to do our best Throughout our lives we have been labeled with our grades; in high school, the ones with low grades were left alone in misery, while the ones with higher grades were praised as the leaders of this horse race. Then, the question that comes into mind is: is it right to categorize students, does grading contribute to education? It is assumed and stated in the philosophy of the current educational system that grading encourages learning and without it students would not study That is far from being true and also expresses another flaw of our education system The system is based on fear the basic motive for students to study is fear of low grades. Furthermore, because the grades are the main criteria for passing courses, students do not study they just develop methods of cheating. Thus, without learning the subject, they keep passing Since grades received in exams are more important than learning the subject matter, all students have to do to pass their courses is memonizing how a specific problem is solved. Without knowing why such a method is used, students cannot apply their ability to solve the problem to daily life. However, they pass exams without learning why, how or what of the matter Another disadvantage of grading is that grades of a student are not updated and will have a great impact in the long run. Apart from these problems, which can be virtually solved by optimizing and improving the grading system, the most important defect of the system cannot be repaired without changing the whole systern. The grading system causes inequalities, superior-inferior relations, classifications, and even conflicts It may be maintained that societies of the modern world are structured on these basic principles, but the fact that something exists does not justify it. Moreover, the people grown up in such an education system will not be able to see the other side of the walls, or will be afraid even to take a glimpse. To sum up, grading students is not a good practice and should be abolished. It is clear that education, especially education during childhood, has a great effect on one's life. And if you bring the children up in conditions of conflict and competition, they will look for conflicts in the future too​</h2><br />

                            9. GRADING by Remzi Yavuz As students we all have been challenged to do our best. Throughout our lives we have been labeled with our grades; in high school, the ones with low grades were left alone in misery, while the ones with higher grades were praised as the leaders of this horse race. Then, the question that comes into mind is: is it right to categorize students, does grading contribute to education? It is assumed and stated in the philosophy of the current educational system that grading encourages learning and without it students would not study. That is far from being true and also expresses another flaw of our education system. The system is based on fear the basic motive for students to study is fear of low grades. Furthermore, because the grades are the main criteria for passing courses, students do not study, they just develop methods of cheating. Thus, without learning the subject, they keep passing. Since grades received in exams are more important than learning the subject matter, all students have to do to pass their courses is memorizing how a specific problem is solved. Without knowing why such a method is used, students cannot apply their ability to solve the problem to daily life. However, they pass exams without learning why, how or what of the matter. Another disadvantage of grading is that grades of a student are not updated and will have a great impact in the long run. Apart from these problems, which can be virtually solved by optimizing and improving the grading system, the most important defect of the system cannot be repaired without changing the whole system. The grading system causes inequalities, superior-inferior relations, classifications, and even conflicts. It may be maintained that societies of the modern world are structured on these basic principles, but the fact that something exists does not justify it. Moreover, the people grown up in such an education system will not be able to see the other side of the walls, or will be afraid even to take a glimpse. To sum up, grading students is not a good practice and should be abolished. It is clear that education, especially education during childhood, has a great effect on one's life. And if you bring the children up in conditions of conflict and competition, they will look for conflicts in the future too. 1. what is the author's reason for writing? 2. what words or phrases prove your answer 3. which paragraph is the introduction 4. which part is the body of the essay 5. what does each paragraph contain 6. which paragraph is the conclusion 7. which does the conclusion ​</h2><br />

                            14. Who won this year’s 7th grade race around the campus? 
Every year at Xavier School for Gifted Youngster, there is an all-class race. Below are the results for the 7th grade (which is made up of four different classes of 7th grade). But there is a problem: no one agrees on who won! One person thinks Class C should win the trophy because they had the 1st runner overall in the race. Another person thinks Class D should win because they had 3 runners come in under 10th place. A third person says: just find the average. But a 4th person said: wait a minute – D Class had way more students in their class than Class C! Averages won’t be fair. A 5th person says: use the scoring system in Cross Country – just add up the place of finish of the top 5 and lowest total wins. A 6th person says – unfair! Some classes did well in the first few runners but poorly in the middle! Why should they win? Now, everyone is confused and arguing. 
What is the most fair solution? Who should win the trophy? Your group, well-known in the school as a group of expert mathematicians (and widely known and respected for your sense of fairness) is being consulted as to who should win the trophy. What will you recommend and why?</h2><br />

                            18. Example ScenarioThe College of Information Technology and Computer Studies has a large numberof student population in the university. Managing an IT student and bringing togetherdepartments and other colleges to achieve the mission is always a big challenge for theThe management. Most are transferees, irregular students and with failed subjectaffected in this situation because they need to provide a copy of grades during advisingperiod and manually write it on the evaluation checklist to monitor their performancegrade in every semester before processing the enrolment.The college coordinators who have an access to verify, update and monitoring thestudent checklists. This checklist is used to back-up the Microsoft Access database thatuses to record the advising record. During the enrolment, the coordinators runs a reportthat will print out the evaluation checklist for the day. Not only does to maintain theevaluation database, but it also uses a copy of grades to validate the grade of the student.Although the MIS enrolment system supports the student viewing of gradesinformation, the Coordinators has noticed some drawbacks. On particular situation the evaluation for the courses have conflicted with missing subject to enrol due toCurriculum used by the student and will cause to failure of completion to the courseprogram. CITCS will like to get information about the automatic assessment of thestudent evaluation of grades per semester. They have been talking about either updating the system or replacing it with a newinformation system that would meet the current and future needs but needs more detailson which option is feasible for the advising procedures. Your tasks is to help come upwith a plan to address these issues.Project AnalysisWrite one-page review and observation in the CITCS Advisingprocedures for enrolment with the intent of improving it through standardmethodology. For this study, provide some discretion as to how would like tostructure the presentation and must address the following requirements abouteach step in the systems analysis design process: a. Planning: Define the scope of the problem.b. Requirements: Justify the functional requirements. Explain what documentation will be used to analyze the needs of the end users to ensure the new system can meet their expectations?c. Design: Use the information that you received from the system requirement documentation to explain how you will design the new or updated system.

According to Fabre (2015), increasing the performance level among the students is common goa as teacher. With this, Interactive Science Notebook (ISN) is an intervention used to increase siudents' performance and interest in learning Science. This study focused on the Grade 9 Frucality students who failed in science subject based on their perfomance task A pretest and posttest were conducted to find out the relatic nship of students learning in science with the help of the Interactive Science Notebook (ISN) as an intervention. Results revealed that the performance task of the students increases as well as their final grades. This is because students leam more if they participate directly in the class performance and gain deeper leaming. When the students are motivated to participate more, there is a great possibility that the written works and quarterly assessment in the grading system will increase significantly. ​</h2><br />

                            24. Mr. Jay Person is the Department Chair of Computer Studies (CS) Department of TABAKOUniversity while Ms. Lee Jane is Mr. Person’s secretary. Tabako University is using a computer system where faculty members are required to personally encode the grades of students, print the grade sheet and submit the signed grade sheet to the department secretary. The department secretary will then submit the grade sheet to the department’s Chair concerned for signature before submitting the hardcopy to the Registrar’s office. Even if the grade sheets are not printed, the same is stored in the computer system and a student concerned will have his grade in the transcript of his records. The printed grade sheet is just a back-up copy of the computer system in case of a system failure.On March 21, 2020 all the grade sheets were already submitted by all CS instructors to Ms. Jane. However, Jane could not submit the same to the registrar’s office because the grade sheet were NOT signed by Mr. Person who attended an intensive Java Boot Camp Seminar being held in Mindanao. Without the knowledge of Mr. Person, Ms. Jane forged the signature of Mr. Person and personally signed on the grade sheet. Jane told herself, “if I will NOT do it, we will be late in the submission of grade sheets, anyway Sir Jay’s signature is only a formal requirement.”​</h2><br />
