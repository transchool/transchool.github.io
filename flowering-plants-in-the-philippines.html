                                            Activity 2 Biodiversity at Three Levels Objective: Identify the levels of biodiversity as the basis for classifying organism and present examples for each. Directions: Read the selection below about the levels of biodiversity. Identify the following by writing SD for Species Diversity, GD for Genetic Diversity, and ED for Ecosystem Diversity. (10pts.) Types of Biodiversity Biodiversity is the variety of living things on Earth. It consists of three levels including species diversity, ecosystem diversity, and genetic diversity. Species diversity is the variety of species in a particular region (e.g. a plant or animal). These are organisms whose members share a set of common features. Normally members of one species do not breed with members of another species. For example, a yellow-fin tuna is a species, and it cannot breed with a skip-jack tuna as they are different species. Examples of endemic species that can be found in the Philippines are Philippine eagle, tamaraw, tarsier, Visayan warty pig, narra tree, and Philippine jade vine. https://tinyurl.com/382bwm2x Ecosystem diversity refers to community of living things that interact with each other and with the environment around them. Examples of physical environment are rainforests. deserts, coral reefs, grassland, and mangroves. https://tinyurl.com/29swdefe Genetic diversity refers to a variety of genes within a species. It increases the chances of survival during changing environmental conditions or during the outbreak of disease. In humans a person's skin color, hair color, dimples, freckles, and blood type are all examples of genetic variations. Other examples of this in plants include modified leaves of carnivorous plants and the development of flowers that resemble insects to lure plant pollinators. Albinism, cheetahs with stripes, snakes that fly, animals that play dead, and animals that mimic leaves are all examples of this. Levels of Biodiversity 1. Animals that mimic leaves 2. Visayan warty pig 3. Mangroves 4. Coral reefs 5. Humans with different skin colors 6. Philippine eagle 7. Tamaraw 8. Rainforests 9. Tarsier 10.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>We have seasons because Earth's axis – the imaginary line that goes through the Earth and around which the Earth spins — is tilted. It's tilted about 23.5 degrees relative to our plane of orbit (the ecliptic) around the Sun. As we orbit our Sun, our axis always points to the same fixed location in space. Our northern axis points almost directly toward Polaris, the North Star.</p><p></p><p>Earth Orbits Our Sun</p><p>This picture shows Earth from its side as it orbits our Sun. The axis is tilted and points to the North Star no matter where Earth is in its orbit. Because of this, the distribution of the Sun's rays changes. In June, in the northern hemisphere summer, the Sun's rays — and warmth — reach all the way to the north pole. In December, in the northern hemisphere winter, the north pole is tilted away from the incoming sunshine.</p><p></p><p>The “fixed” tilt means that, during our orbit around our Sun each year, different parts of Earth receive sunlight for different lengths of time. It also means that the angle at which sunlight strikes different parts of Earth's surface changes through the year. Sunlight striking the surface at an angle is “spread” across a wider area compared to sunlight striking perpendicular to Earth's surface. Areas that receive more scattered sunlight receive less energy from our Sun. All of these factors combine to give Earth its annual cycle of seasons!</p><p></p><p>Sun's Rays</p><p>For part of our orbit the northern half of Earth is tilted toward the Sun. This is summer in the northern hemisphere; there are longer periods of daylight, the Sun is higher in the sky, and the Sun's rays strike the surface more directly, giving us warmer temperatures. </p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.rotation</p><p>2.sping</p><p>3.four</p><p>4.two</p><p>5.revolution</p><p>6.rainy</p><p>7.fall/autumn</p><p>8.snow</p><p>9.summer</p><p>10.seasons</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>goodluckk</p><p></p><br />

                            17. Activity 2 Biodiversity at Three Levels Objective: Identify the levels of biodiversity as the basis for classifying organism and present examples for each. Directions: Read the selection below about the levels of biodiversity. Identify the following by writing SD for Species Diversity, GD for Genetic Diversity, and ED for Ecosystem Diversity. (10pts.) Types of Biodiversity Biodiversity is the variety of living things on Earth. It consists of three levels including species diversity, ecosystem diversity, and genetic diversity. Species diversity is the variety of species in a particular region (e.g. a plant or animal). These are organisms whose members share a set of common features. Normally members of one species do not breed with members of another species. For example, a yellow-fin tuna is a species, and it cannot breed with a skip-jack tuna as they are different species. Examples of endemic species that can be found in the Philippines are Philippine eagle, tamaraw, tarsier, Visayan warty pig, narra tree, and Philippine jade vine. https://tinyurl.com/382bwm2x Ecosystem diversity refers to community of living things that interact with each other and with the environment around them. Examples of physical environment are rainforests. deserts, coral reefs, grassland, and mangroves. https://tinyurl.com/29swdefe Genetic diversity refers to a variety of genes within a species. It increases the chances of survival during changing environmental conditions or during the outbreak of disease. In humans a person's skin color, hair color, dimples, freckles, and blood type are all examples of genetic variations. Other examples of this in plants include modified leaves of carnivorous plants and the development of flowers that resemble insects to lure plant pollinators. Albinism, cheetahs with stripes, snakes that fly, animals that play dead, and animals that mimic leaves are all examples of this. Levels of Biodiversity 1. Animals that mimic leaves 2. Visayan warty pig 3. Mangroves 4. Coral reefs 5. Humans with different skin colors 6. Philippine eagle 7. Tamaraw 8. Rainforests 9. Tarsier 10.

It is one of the ways in which the English language is flexible and always changing, as compound words allow people to create new words as the need arises.</p><p>TYPES:</p><p>Closed-Form Compound Word Examples
</p><p>Closed compound words are formed when two fully independent, unique words are combined to create a new word. For example, you would combine “grand” and “mother” to create the closed-form word “grandmother”. In a sentence, this would look like, “My grandmother is coming over.” These are the most common types of compound words.
</p><p>
</p><p>For example:
</p><p>
</p><p>bullfrog
</p><p>snowball
</p><p>mailbox</p><p></p><p>Open compound words are formed when two words remain separate on the page but are used together to create a new idea with a specific meaning. For example, “attorney” and “general” are used to form the open compound word “attorney general”. You could see this in the sentence, “The attorney general holds the power in legal matters.” Other examples of open compounds include:
</p><p>
</p><p>peanut butter
</p><p>Boy Scouts
</p><p>no one
</p><p></p><p>Hyphenated compound words are formed when two separate words are joined together by a hyphen. Examples of hyphenated compound words include:
</p><p>
</p><p>two-fold
</p><p>check-in
</p><p>merry-go-round</p><p></p><p>#BRAINLYFAST!
