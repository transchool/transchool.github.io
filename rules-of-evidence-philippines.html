                                            It’s herd complacency, and it has increasingly become evident in many areas. Masks are no longer worn, or used mainly as decoration, hanging below the chin, or not covering the nose – the easier for sneezing and spreading potentially infectious droplets all around. Face shields are worn only when cops approach. Distancing is even worse, with crowds jostling in wet markets and passengers again packed into jeepneys. Families and neighbors have also resumed get-togethers, during which masks are off even if not eating or drinking. With COVID cases surging in the past two weeks, possibly due to the arrival of more infectious coronavirus variants, both the national and local governments have decided to tighten the enforcement of health safety protocols. More cops have been deployed in cities where granular lockdowns have been imposed as well as in commercial areas. In Caloocan City, quarantine passes are again required for shopping. Yesterday, the government announced that police Special Action Force teams would be deployed to help enforce the health protocols. The government should adopt measures to prevent the deployment from exacerbating COVID transmission among members of the Philippine National Police. After a year of restrictions, however, the government should also know enough to prevent a repeat of the abuses of the past in the enforcement of health protocols. In April last year, an unarmed retired Army veteran suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder was fatally shot in the back at a police COVID checkpoint. In Ilocos, two teenage girls were molested and raped by cops who apprehended them for violating the curfew. When the girls filed a complaint about the sexual assault, one of them was shot dead by the same cops. Those were just the worst cases. Most of the other cases involved the unnecessary use of force or unusual punishment for the offense. By this time, the police should know enough about the calibrated use of state power to enforce rules for the public good. With the more infectious COVID variants, one of which is said to be deadlier than the original, now spreading in the country, and with vaccination just getting started, there is clearly a need to remind the public that the risks of infection and possible death are still very much around, and will remain so for many more months Source: https://www.philstar.com/opinion/2021/03/12/2083649/editorial-herd-complacency 2.

                                            Additional Activities THE PHILIPPINE PRE-COLONIAL SOCIAL STRATIFICATION Over the course of this lesson, you have informed about the concept, characteristics, and forms of stratification systems. Did you know that before the Philippines were colonized by the Spaniards, Americans, and Japanese, the Philippine pre-colonial society was already establishing social stratification through factors such as wealth, power, rights, privileges, entitlement and achievements? Meet these groups of people one by one once again by reading the given description. Afterwards, answer the activity below. The TIMAWA. They were the majority of the barangay community. They were free. They could acquire property, have any job they wanted, pick their own wives, and acquire an alipin. They were expected to support the datu and pay their taxes; hence, their importance in the community was evident. The MAGINOO. They were the ruling class, the educated class, the royal class, and the privileged class. It was from this class which the datu came from. The datu was the head of the community called a barangay. He is synonymous to a monarch, rajah, sultan, and king to other countries. The ALIPIN. They had the least rights. They served their master who belonged to one of the classes that is above them. The Alipin was likely his or her servant at home such as doing the household chores and cooking, or aided the timawa with their duties at work. The MAHARLIKA. They were well respected if not revered by the barangay. Unlike the timawa, they were not expected to pay taxes. They would provide protection to the barangay and were responsible for providing and preparing the weapons at their own expense.​</a>

                                            It’s herd complacency, and it has increasingly become evident in many areas. Masks are no longer worn, or used mainly as decoration, hanging below the chin, or not covering the nose – the easier for sneezing and spreading potentially infectious droplets all around. Face shields are worn only when cops approach. Distancing is even worse, with crowds jostling in wet markets and passengers again packed into jeepneys. Families and neighbors have also resumed get-togethers, during which masks are off even if not eating or drinking. With COVID cases surging in the past two weeks, possibly due to the arrival of more infectious coronavirus variants, both the national and local governments have decided to tighten the enforcement of health safety protocols. More cops have been deployed in cities where granular lockdowns have been imposed as well as in commercial areas. In Caloocan City, quarantine passes are again required for shopping. Yesterday, the government announced that police Special Action Force teams would be deployed to help enforce the health protocols. The government should adopt measures to prevent the deployment from exacerbating COVID transmission among members of the Philippine National Police. After a year of restrictions, however, the government should also know enough to prevent a repeat of the abuses of the past in the enforcement of health protocols. In April last year, an unarmed retired Army veteran suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder was fatally shot in the back at a police COVID checkpoint. In Ilocos, two teenage girls were molested and raped by cops who apprehended them for violating the curfew. When the girls filed a complaint about the sexual assault, one of them was shot dead by the same cops. Those were just the worst cases. Most of the other cases involved the unnecessary use of force or unusual punishment for the offense. By this time, the police should know enough about the calibrated use of state power to enforce rules for the public good. With the more infectious COVID variants, one of which is said to be deadlier than the original, now spreading in the country, and with vaccination just getting started, there is clearly a need to remind the public that the risks of infection and possible death are still very much around, and will remain so for many more months Source: https://www.philstar.com/opinion/2021/03/12/2083649/editorial-herd-complacency 1.

When I was a boy, one of the rules at home that II did not like at all was to be made to lie on the bare floor of our sala after lunch. I usually lay side by side with two other children in the family. We were forced to sleep by my mother. She watched us as she darned old dresses, read an awit, or hummed a cradle song in Tagalog." (from "Siesta", Leopoldo R. Serrano) 47. "The custom of having a siesta was introduced in our country by the Spaniards. Indeed, during the Spanish times, the Philippines was the land of the fiesta, the novena, and the siesta." (Siesta, Leopoldo R. Serrano) 48. "He looked about for a house he could go to and lose his bad feeling. He almost jumped up in delight. He had reached the edge of the barrio and so must be near the house of Mang Tinoy and Aling Nadang. Mang Tinoy was a forester. He took care of the big forest back of Lian. He and Aling Nadang had many children and a cozy, nipa house with big family rooms." (from " A Family for Tomas" by Loreto Paras-Sulit) 49. "Tomas had often spent the night with them when he went to the forest to gather firewood to sell in order to earn a peso or more for himself."

Princess Urduja is a mere legend, and not a historical figure.
According to legend, the Filipino heroine Princess Urduja ruled an island called Tawalisi in the 14th century. She led a group of warrior women called Kinalakihan, or the Amazons, across battlefields, and was known for her kindness and intelligence. She is said to have taken no husband because she would only choose a man who was braver, wiser, and stronger than she was, and nobody had enough guts to try to beat her in battle. However, it’s also believed by many that Urduja actually existed — as there were records of her in the accounts of Moroccan traveler and scholar Ibn Battuta. A common theory is that Tawalisi was located in what is now known as Pangasinan, although common guesses for the princess’ native home also include Java, Cambodia, and China.
Lapu-Lapu killed Ferdinand Magellan.
Even first-graders know Lapu-Lapu, the ruler of Mactan who is also the first Philippine hero. He led his men to win the battle of Mactan against Portuguese colonizer Ferdinand Magellan (who probably preferred to be called “explorer” and, by the way, obviously did not “discover” the Philippines), and is usually said to have killed Magellan in the fight. The image may inspire nationalism, but the truth is, it’s impossible to tell whether Magellan did lose his life directly at the hands of Lapu-Lapu, who may be less young and vital than he is commonly depicted.
Jose Rizal wrote “Sa Aking Mga Kabata” in his childhood.
The poem “Sa Aking Mga Kabata,” written in Tagalog about embracing one’s native language, is often attributed to Dr. Jose Rizal, who supposedly wrote it when he was seven years old — “proof,” according to some, of his precocious nature and love of country. Historians such as Ambeth Ocampo, however, have researched and written in opposition of this, stating that there’s no evidence (whether it be a manuscript, a published byline, or an assertion from Rizal himself) supporting Rizal’s authorship of the work. In addition to this, Rizal did not have a strong enough command of Tagalog to match the fluency of the poem.
The viral love letter “Liham Para Kay Oryang” was written by Andres Bonifacio.
In 2015, the work of epistolary fiction “Liham Para Kay Oryang,” written by playwright Eljay Castro Deldoc as though it were a letter from Andres Bonifacio to his wife Gregoria de Jesus a few nights before he was killed, went viral on social media and reached far enough that people began to believe Bonifacio had actually written it. It was romantic and relayed the urgency of love and loss during wartime — but it was just the writer’s interpretation of historical events. On that note, a real poem written by Gregoria de Jesus, titled “Magmula, Giliw, Nang Ikaw ay Pumanaw,” was verified by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines. Talking about her grief over losing Bonifacio, it was copied by hand by her second husband Julio Nakpil, and is now on display in the Bahay-Nakpil museum.
Fernando Poe Sr. served as the model for the Oblation.
Commissioned for the University of the Philippines by then-president Rafael Palma and funded by the enrollees in 1935, the iconic statue known as the Oblation, or simply Oble, was created by Guillermo E. Tolentino and based on Rizal’s poem “Mi Ultimo Adios.” The symbol and touchstone of any UP campus is often said to have taken its physique from actor-director Fernando Poe, Sr., who was a UP student at the time of its creation; however, records show that Anastacio Caedo, a student assistant of Tolentino’s, and Caedo’s brother-in-law Virgilio Raymundo served as the models and references. Another fact that might not be all that well known? The original sculpture is located not in front of Quezon Hall along UP Diliman’s University Avenue, but instead inside Gonzales Hall.
The yo-yo was invented by ancient Filipinos.
It’s too simple to say the yo-yo was invented by a Filipino, and it’s almost impossible to determine its true origins: it traces its existence back to ancient Greece and arrived in Europe in the 1800s, long before it was trademarked and sold en masse in America. But in the late 1920s, a Filipino bellboy named Pedro Flores, who had traveled to the United States in hopes of studying law, innovated a stringing method that elevated the yo-yo from being a simple toy to the type we all know and can do tricks with today. He mass-produced his creation and established a yo-yo manufacturing company, but eventually sold the rights.</a>

                            6. It’s herd complacency, and it has increasingly become evident in many areas. Masks are no longer worn, or used mainly as decoration, hanging below the chin, or not covering the nose – the easier for sneezing and spreading potentially infectious droplets all around. Face shields are worn only when cops approach. Distancing is even worse, with crowds jostling in wet markets and passengers again packed into jeepneys. Families and neighbors have also resumed get-togethers, during which masks are off even if not eating or drinking. With COVID cases surging in the past two weeks, possibly due to the arrival of more infectious coronavirus variants, both the national and local governments have decided to tighten the enforcement of health safety protocols. More cops have been deployed in cities where granular lockdowns have been imposed as well as in commercial areas. In Caloocan City, quarantine passes are again required for shopping. Yesterday, the government announced that police Special Action Force teams would be deployed to help enforce the health protocols. The government should adopt measures to prevent the deployment from exacerbating COVID transmission among members of the Philippine National Police. After a year of restrictions, however, the government should also know enough to prevent a repeat of the abuses of the past in the enforcement of health protocols. In April last year, an unarmed retired Army veteran suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder was fatally shot in the back at a police COVID checkpoint. In Ilocos, two teenage girls were molested and raped by cops who apprehended them for violating the curfew. When the girls filed a complaint about the sexual assault, one of them was shot dead by the same cops. Those were just the worst cases. Most of the other cases involved the unnecessary use of force or unusual punishment for the offense. By this time, the police should know enough about the calibrated use of state power to enforce rules for the public good. With the more infectious COVID variants, one of which is said to be deadlier than the original, now spreading in the country, and with vaccination just getting started, there is clearly a need to remind the public that the risks of infection and possible death are still very much around, and will remain so for many more months Source: https://www.philstar.com/opinion/2021/03/12/2083649/editorial-herd-complacency 2.

Additional Activities THE PHILIPPINE PRE-COLONIAL SOCIAL STRATIFICATION Over the course of this lesson, you have informed about the concept, characteristics, and forms of stratification systems. Did you know that before the Philippines were colonized by the Spaniards, Americans, and Japanese, the Philippine pre-colonial society was already establishing social stratification through factors such as wealth, power, rights, privileges, entitlement and achievements? Meet these groups of people one by one once again by reading the given description. Afterwards, answer the activity below. The TIMAWA. They were the majority of the barangay community. They were free. They could acquire property, have any job they wanted, pick their own wives, and acquire an alipin. They were expected to support the datu and pay their taxes; hence, their importance in the community was evident. The MAGINOO. They were the ruling class, the educated class, the royal class, and the privileged class. It was from this class which the datu came from. The datu was the head of the community called a barangay. He is synonymous to a monarch, rajah, sultan, and king to other countries. The ALIPIN. They had the least rights. They served their master who belonged to one of the classes that is above them. The Alipin was likely his or her servant at home such as doing the household chores and cooking, or aided the timawa with their duties at work. The MAHARLIKA. They were well respected if not revered by the barangay. Unlike the timawa, they were not expected to pay taxes. They would provide protection to the barangay and were responsible for providing and preparing the weapons at their own expense.​</h2><br />

                            13. It’s herd complacency, and it has increasingly become evident in many areas. Masks are no longer worn, or used mainly as decoration, hanging below the chin, or not covering the nose – the easier for sneezing and spreading potentially infectious droplets all around. Face shields are worn only when cops approach. Distancing is even worse, with crowds jostling in wet markets and passengers again packed into jeepneys. Families and neighbors have also resumed get-togethers, during which masks are off even if not eating or drinking. With COVID cases surging in the past two weeks, possibly due to the arrival of more infectious coronavirus variants, both the national and local governments have decided to tighten the enforcement of health safety protocols. More cops have been deployed in cities where granular lockdowns have been imposed as well as in commercial areas. In Caloocan City, quarantine passes are again required for shopping. Yesterday, the government announced that police Special Action Force teams would be deployed to help enforce the health protocols. The government should adopt measures to prevent the deployment from exacerbating COVID transmission among members of the Philippine National Police. After a year of restrictions, however, the government should also know enough to prevent a repeat of the abuses of the past in the enforcement of health protocols. In April last year, an unarmed retired Army veteran suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder was fatally shot in the back at a police COVID checkpoint. In Ilocos, two teenage girls were molested and raped by cops who apprehended them for violating the curfew. When the girls filed a complaint about the sexual assault, one of them was shot dead by the same cops. Those were just the worst cases. Most of the other cases involved the unnecessary use of force or unusual punishment for the offense. By this time, the police should know enough about the calibrated use of state power to enforce rules for the public good. With the more infectious COVID variants, one of which is said to be deadlier than the original, now spreading in the country, and with vaccination just getting started, there is clearly a need to remind the public that the risks of infection and possible death are still very much around, and will remain so for many more months Source: https://www.philstar.com/opinion/2021/03/12/2083649/editorial-herd-complacency 1.

When I was a boy, one of the rules at home that II did not like at all was to be made to lie on the bare floor of our sala after lunch. I usually lay side by side with two other children in the family. We were forced to sleep by my mother. She watched us as she darned old dresses, read an awit, or hummed a cradle song in Tagalog." (from "Siesta", Leopoldo R. Serrano) 47. "The custom of having a siesta was introduced in our country by the Spaniards. Indeed, during the Spanish times, the Philippines was the land of the fiesta, the novena, and the siesta." (Siesta, Leopoldo R. Serrano) 48. "He looked about for a house he could go to and lose his bad feeling. He almost jumped up in delight. He had reached the edge of the barrio and so must be near the house of Mang Tinoy and Aling Nadang. Mang Tinoy was a forester. He took care of the big forest back of Lian. He and Aling Nadang had many children and a cozy, nipa house with big family rooms." (from " A Family for Tomas" by Loreto Paras-Sulit) 49. "Tomas had often spent the night with them when he went to the forest to gather firewood to sell in order to earn a peso or more for himself."

Princess Urduja is a mere legend, and not a historical figure.
According to legend, the Filipino heroine Princess Urduja ruled an island called Tawalisi in the 14th century. She led a group of warrior women called Kinalakihan, or the Amazons, across battlefields, and was known for her kindness and intelligence. She is said to have taken no husband because she would only choose a man who was braver, wiser, and stronger than she was, and nobody had enough guts to try to beat her in battle. However, it’s also believed by many that Urduja actually existed — as there were records of her in the accounts of Moroccan traveler and scholar Ibn Battuta. A common theory is that Tawalisi was located in what is now known as Pangasinan, although common guesses for the princess’ native home also include Java, Cambodia, and China.
Lapu-Lapu killed Ferdinand Magellan.
Even first-graders know Lapu-Lapu, the ruler of Mactan who is also the first Philippine hero. He led his men to win the battle of Mactan against Portuguese colonizer Ferdinand Magellan (who probably preferred to be called “explorer” and, by the way, obviously did not “discover” the Philippines), and is usually said to have killed Magellan in the fight. The image may inspire nationalism, but the truth is, it’s impossible to tell whether Magellan did lose his life directly at the hands of Lapu-Lapu, who may be less young and vital than he is commonly depicted.
Jose Rizal wrote “Sa Aking Mga Kabata” in his childhood.
The poem “Sa Aking Mga Kabata,” written in Tagalog about embracing one’s native language, is often attributed to Dr. Jose Rizal, who supposedly wrote it when he was seven years old — “proof,” according to some, of his precocious nature and love of country. Historians such as Ambeth Ocampo, however, have researched and written in opposition of this, stating that there’s no evidence (whether it be a manuscript, a published byline, or an assertion from Rizal himself) supporting Rizal’s authorship of the work. In addition to this, Rizal did not have a strong enough command of Tagalog to match the fluency of the poem.
The viral love letter “Liham Para Kay Oryang” was written by Andres Bonifacio.
In 2015, the work of epistolary fiction “Liham Para Kay Oryang,” written by playwright Eljay Castro Deldoc as though it were a letter from Andres Bonifacio to his wife Gregoria de Jesus a few nights before he was killed, went viral on social media and reached far enough that people began to believe Bonifacio had actually written it. It was romantic and relayed the urgency of love and loss during wartime — but it was just the writer’s interpretation of historical events. On that note, a real poem written by Gregoria de Jesus, titled “Magmula, Giliw, Nang Ikaw ay Pumanaw,” was verified by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines. Talking about her grief over losing Bonifacio, it was copied by hand by her second husband Julio Nakpil, and is now on display in the Bahay-Nakpil museum.
Fernando Poe Sr. served as the model for the Oblation.
Commissioned for the University of the Philippines by then-president Rafael Palma and funded by the enrollees in 1935, the iconic statue known as the Oblation, or simply Oble, was created by Guillermo E. Tolentino and based on Rizal’s poem “Mi Ultimo Adios.” The symbol and touchstone of any UP campus is often said to have taken its physique from actor-director Fernando Poe, Sr., who was a UP student at the time of its creation; however, records show that Anastacio Caedo, a student assistant of Tolentino’s, and Caedo’s brother-in-law Virgilio Raymundo served as the models and references. Another fact that might not be all that well known? The original sculpture is located not in front of Quezon Hall along UP Diliman’s University Avenue, but instead inside Gonzales Hall.
The yo-yo was invented by ancient Filipinos.
It’s too simple to say the yo-yo was invented by a Filipino, and it’s almost impossible to determine its true origins: it traces its existence back to ancient Greece and arrived in Europe in the 1800s, long before it was trademarked and sold en masse in America. But in the late 1920s, a Filipino bellboy named Pedro Flores, who had traveled to the United States in hopes of studying law, innovated a stringing method that elevated the yo-yo from being a simple toy to the type we all know and can do tricks with today. He mass-produced his creation and established a yo-yo manufacturing company, but eventually sold the rights.</h2><br />
