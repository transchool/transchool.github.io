Which proofs can you give?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The K to 10 curriculum guide for Edukasyon sa Pagpapakatao (EPS) and the Grade 11-12 Curriculum guide for Philosophy of the Human Person and Personal Development do contain content and activities that aim to help students develop positive character traits and values. However, I cannot confirm that these curriculum guides are specifically designed to "eliminate the weaknesses of the Filipino character."</p><p></p><p>The EPS curriculum guide, for example, includes topics such as self-awareness, self-esteem, and self-direction, which can be seen as tools for personal development. It also includes topics on values education, responsible citizenship, and community involvement, which can be seen as ways to help students become more responsible members of society.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, the Grade 11-12 Curriculum guide for Philosophy of the Human Person and Personal Development provides students with an understanding of the nature of human person and its relation to the society. It provides students with the knowledge and skills needed to reflect on and evaluate their own beliefs, values, and behaviors, which can be seen as a way to help students become more self-aware, self-directed, and ethical.</p><p></p><p>It's important to note that the curriculum guides are only one aspect of the Philippine educational system, and other factors such as teacher training, instructional practices, and student and parent attitudes and expectations also play a role in shaping student character and development.</p><br />
