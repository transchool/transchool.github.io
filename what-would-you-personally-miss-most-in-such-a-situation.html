</p><p><strong>Additional Knowlede:</strong>
</p><p>
</p>What would you personally miss most in such a situation without media?
Do you mean books when you say "media"? What about television? What is the internet? What are the news media? What is social media? Is it all media? Without any kind of media, humanity cannot act as a culture. However, it would be preferable to be free of other newspapers. For five years, I avoided the press, television, magazines, and radio.  <p>
</p>Nowadays, you must filter all newspapers, including alternative news sources, social media pages that silence your thoughts, and books that fictionalize history.
The blogs and newsletters that also include a plan. It is no longer as straightforward as it once was.
I don't miss much -personally, because the media has long understood that bad news sells the most. The same way that Hollywood understands that death, murder, narcotics, and criminality all appeal to a larger audience.
I use the internet to watch old movies and TV shows from my childhood. When it was imaginative, not partisan, and had unexpected ends rather than the boring garbage of today.

If there were no media. I, like many others, would do well, and it would strengthen my analytical abilities and make me more Earth-centered wise!  <p>
