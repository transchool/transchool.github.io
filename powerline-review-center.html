Wells are drilled deep into the earth to pump steam or hot water to the surface.
When the water reaches the surface, the drop in pressure causes the water to turn  into steam.
The steam spins a turbine, which is connected to a generator that produces electricity.
Cooling tower cools the steam which it condenses back to water.
The cooled water is pumped back into the earth to begin the process again.
