Cause and Effectc. Comparison and Contrastd. Sequencee. Problem-Solution______1. On the river banks of the Nile River, home to some crocodiles, there are many kinds of birds, sometimes called crocodile birds because they are always hopping around crocodiles. The big crocodiles and the birds are useful to each other for several reasons. The birds eat flies and leeches and flies. Sometimes an enemy frightens the birds who scream and fly away. As a result of the noise, the birds gives  the crocodiles a warning of danger.Source: Pike and Mumper (2004)_________2. Alligators and crocodiles, along with their relatives the caimans and the gavials, are very much alike. These crocodilians are reptiles with long snouts,long tails,four short legs,tough skin, and sharp teeth. There are some differences, however. Gavials have the longest snout and the most teeth. Some people say that alligators and crocodiles differ in the shape of their snouts and the positioning of their teeth. Some people say that alligators and crocodiles differ in shape of their snouts the positioning of their teeth. Zookeepers say that crocodiles move faster than alligators and have nastier dispositions. Source: Pike and Mumper (2004)_______3. Coral snakes are distinguished by their red, yellow/white and black colored banding. Most species are small in size. North American species average around 3 feet in length, but specimens of up to 5 feet or slightly larger than alligators and have been reported_______4. A beech tree has very smooth bark. Unfortunately, this can cause a problem for the tree. Sometimes people decide that they want to write their names in the bark. When they do this, they can harm the tree. Diseases can attack the tree through the cuts in the bark. Trees can die because of these diseases.______5. Ted and Sam both wanted to drive the car. They started yelling at each other. Their mom came and told them to stop fighting. She told Ted he could drive the car today, and Sam would have turn tomorrow._______6. Viruses contain protein and genetic material. But viruses don't act like living things. They can't eat, grow, break down food or use oxygen. In fact, a virus cannot function on its own. A virus can reproduce only inside a living cell that serves as a host. A host is living cell that a virus or parasite lives on or in. Using a host's cell as a tiny factory, the virus forces the host to make viruses rather than healthy new cells._______7. I used to hate cats. I thought they were selfish, smelly animals that scratched a bit people. Then, I got one as pet. Because of that, my cat is my best friend. He is sweet cuddly, and soft. He doesn't smell, and he doesn't bite. Now I love cats. If you try something new, then maybe you will find you don't hate it as much as you might._______8. The cardinal and the cedar waxwing are two common birds. Both have crests on their heads, and both are often seen at birdfeeders. But the birds do have some differences. The male cardinal is a bright red, while the waxwing is brown. The cedar waxwing often migrates from place to place. On the other hand, the cardinal stays in one place year after year._______9. In the spring, toads lay their eggs in ponds, lakes, and puddles. Then, tiny tadpoles come out of the eggs. The tadpoles live in the water for several weeks. Next, the tadpoles start to develop back legs, and then front legs. Finally, the tadpoles lose their tails. They are ready to come out of the water as tiny, tiny, toads.________10. In the northern areas, the weather is too cold to grow crops all year long. But some farmers have found a way to grow food all year. A green house is a special building that stays warm in the winter. Crops like lettuce and basil can grow well in the greenhouse, even the wheather is cold.pls paki answer po ng kumpleto at maayos ty po:)​</a>

On the river banks of the Nile River, home to some crocodiles, there are many kinds of birds, sometimes called crocodile birds because they are always hopping around crocodiles. The big crocodiles and the birds are useful to each other for several reasons. The birds eat flies and leeches and flies. Sometimes an enemy frightens the birds who scream and fly away. As a result of the noise, the birds gives  the crocodiles a warning of danger.Source: Pike and Mumper (2004)_________2. Alligators and crocodiles, along with their relatives the caimans and the gavials, are very much alike. These crocodilians are reptiles with long snouts,long tails,four short legs,tough skin, and sharp teeth. There are some differences, however. Gavials have the longest snout and the most teeth. Some people say that alligators and crocodiles differ in the shape of their snouts and the positioning of their teeth. Some people say that alligators and crocodiles differ in shape of their snouts the positioning of their teeth. Zookeepers say that crocodiles move faster than alligators and have nastier dispositions. Source: Pike and Mumper (2004)_______3. Coral snakes are distinguished by their red, yellow/white and black colored banding. Most species are small in size. North American species average around 3 feet in length, but specimens of up to 5 feet or slightly larger than alligators and have been reported_______4. A beech tree has very smooth bark. Unfortunately, this can cause a problem for the tree. Sometimes people decide that they want to write their names in the bark. When they do this, they can harm the tree. Diseases can attack the tree through the cuts in the bark. Trees can die because of these diseases.______5. Ted and Sam both wanted to drive the car. They started yelling at each other. Their mom came and told them to stop fighting. She told Ted he could drive the car today, and Sam would have turn tomorrow._______6. Viruses contain protein and genetic material. But viruses don't act like living things. They can't eat, grow, break down food or use oxygen. In fact, a virus cannot function on its own. A virus can reproduce only inside a living cell that serves as a host. A host is living cell that a virus or parasite lives on or in. Using a host's cell as a tiny factory, the virus forces the host to make viruses rather than healthy new cells._______7. I used to hate cats. I thought they were selfish, smelly animals that scratched a bit people. Then, I got one as pet. Because of that, my cat is my best friend. He is sweet cuddly, and soft. He doesn't smell, and he doesn't bite. Now I love cats. If you try something new, then maybe you will find you don't hate it as much as you might._______8. The cardinal and the cedar waxwing are two common birds. Both have crests on their heads, and both are often seen at birdfeeders. But the birds do have some differences. The male cardinal is a bright red, while the waxwing is brown. The cedar waxwing often migrates from place to place. On the other hand, the cardinal stays in one place year after year._______9. In the spring, toads lay their eggs in ponds, lakes, and puddles. Then, tiny tadpoles come out of the eggs. The tadpoles live in the water for several weeks. Next, the tadpoles start to develop back legs, and then front legs. Finally, the tadpoles lose their tails. They are ready to come out of the water as tiny, tiny, toads.________10. In the northern areas, the weather is too cold to grow crops all year long. But some farmers have found a way to grow food all year. A green house is a special building that stays warm in the winter. Crops like lettuce and basil can grow well in the greenhouse, even the wheather is cold.pls paki answer po ng kumpleto at maayos ty po:)​</h2><br />
