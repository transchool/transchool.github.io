                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>1. Where did the story happen?</strong></p><p></p><p>There are several locations but the main setting was <strong>in the garden</strong> and in the <strong>kitchen.</strong></p><p>Other locations were in Bulacan and in the dining area of Liza's house.</p><p><strong>2. Who were the characters in the story?</strong></p><p></p><p>The characters are:</p><p>Liza</p><p>Meg - Liza's younger sister</p><p>Tita Loleng </p><p>Liza's Father</p><p>Liza's Mother</p><p>Sylvia - Liza's father's concubine</p><p>Lem - Liza's half brother who died </p><p><strong>3. What</strong></p><p>Liza, from the story was originally close with his father until she found out that her father has another family.</p><p></p><p><strong>4. What was the most interesting part of the story?</strong></p><p></p><p>The most interesting part of the story for me as the reader is that the woman Liza's father had another child apologized to her. It is unusual for me to actually know that if you know you made a mistake towards another person, that person will take responsibility from that action and really apologize for what he has done.</p><p></p><p><strong>5. What was the story about?</strong></p><p></p><p>The story is about forgiveness. That in a family no matter how huge the mistake that was done towards you, there should always be room for forgiveness and acceptance, specially if whoever did you that mistake is a family member. </p><p>I think this story was also entitled "Sinigang" because similarly with the infamous pinoy dish, the taste of sinigang is sour but is a delicious treat to anyone who tries it. Just like in life, most of the time it may not be a smooth sailing life. We experience problems, but those problems is what makes us special. Our life may feel like the sourness of sinigang but if see our life in a bigger picture - it is beautiful.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>6.

Maria Makiling is the guardian spirit of the mountain, responsible for protecting its bounty and thus is also a benefactor for the townspeople who depend on the mountain's resources. In addition to being a guardian of the mountain, some legends also identify Laguna de Bay-and the fish caught from it-as part of her domain. She was sent by Bathala to aid the people of the area in their everyday life.</p><p></p><p>It is often said that Mount Makiling resembles the profile of a woman, said to be Maria herself. This phenomenon is described as true from several different perspectives, so there is no single location associated with this claim. The mountain's various peaks are said to be Maria's face and two breasts, respectively, and her hair cascades downwards a gentle slope away from her body</p><p></p><p>3. When she fell in love with a hunter who had wandered into her kingdom. Soon the two became lovers, with the hunter coming up the mountain every day. They promised to love each other forever.</p><p></p><p>4. In the “Legend of Maria Makiling”, the resolution starts where Maria's wish was granted when Gat Dula won the war between him and Lakan Dulo and by the time Gat Dula died, his soul was given to her for them to continue their love in the heavens.</p><p></p><p>5. Maria makiling and her beloved were buried in the center of the village and by the next day there was a volcano that appeared out of nowhere...people say the smoke coming out of the volcano(Maria Makiling) was the powerful general that wanted Maria all to himself that also died after the war and Maria's beloved was always there to calm her down whenever she remembered what the general did</p><p></p><p></p><strong>Mark </strong><strong>me </strong><strong>as </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>brainliest </strong><br />
