                                            Heart beats fast
Colors and promises
How to be brave?
How can I love when I'm afraid to fall?
But watching you stand alone
All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow
One step closer
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
Time stands still
Beauty in all she is
I will be brave
I will not let anything take away
What's standing in front of me
Every breath
Every hour has come to this
One step closer
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
One step closer
One step closer
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

Colors and promises
How to be brave?
How can I love when I'm afraid to fall?
But watching you stand alone
All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow
One step closer
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
Time stands still
Beauty in all she is
I will be brave
I will not let anything take away
What's standing in front of me
Every breath
Every hour has come to this
One step closer
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
One step closer
One step closer
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

Just like I'm about to sink, just like I'm about to meltOnly the two of us at night in the vast skyIt was only a simple goodbyeBut it was all I needed to understandThe sinking sun, the rising night skyOverlaps with your figure behind the fenceEver since the first day we metYou stole my heartLike you were wrapped in fragile airYou had a lonely gazeIn the world always ringing with "tick-tocks," again and againTouching the heartless words and loud voicesEven if tears are about to spillIf it were the two of us togetherI'm sure mundane happiness could be foundIn the troubling days, for the never-smiling youI give my utmost love in hopes for the dazzling tomorrowIn the never ending night before we fallCome and take my handEven the days that you hid inside, wanting to forgetIt'll melt with the warmth of my embracesNo need to be afraid, until dawn comes somedayLet's be togetherI hate it when you stare at the things only you can seeLike you're captivated by it, or you're in loveI hate that expressionThe things I want to believe but I can't no matter what I doThey'll repeatedly appear, and every time, I'll get angry and cryEven so, some day we'll surely, we'll understand each otherI believe in it"I don't want this, I'm tired of it"I frantically reach for your handBut you push my hands away"I don't want this, I'm tired of it"To tell the truth, I want to say that, tooIn the world always ringing with "tick-tocks," again and againNone of the words I've prepared for you reached you"I want to end it all"When I went along and said thatYou smiled for the first timeIn the troubling days, I became unable to smileThe reflection of you in my eyes is truly beautifulThe overflowing tears on the never-ending nightAll dissolve into your smileIn the never-changing days when I criedYou seduce me with your tenderness towards the endJust like I'm about to sink, just like I'm about to meltThe staining fog dissipatesIn the days that I hide inside, wanting to forgetI take your hand as you extend it towards meIt's like the cold breeze is swimming through the skyBlowing through usDon't ever let go of my handThe both of us, racing into the nightYOASOBI - Racing into the Night/Yoru ni Kakeru (English Translation)This song is actually about suicide, it’ll make alot more sense if you go check out the music video.How do you feel after reading the lyrics? ​</h2><br />
