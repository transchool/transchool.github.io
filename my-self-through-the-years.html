This allows the reader's ideas about how the world works that goes far beyond own experiences. We learn about things through television, movies, magazines, and newspapers. Often, it is the text-to-world connections that teachers are trying to enhance when they teach lessons in science, social studies, and literature. personal Example: I saw a program on television that talked about things described in this article.

Perhaps, since I am a high school student, somebody might say that I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of its beautiful experiences. But despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which, I am sure I will carry with me until my last days. What I am talking about here is my first hike to the mountains. *7. Sexuality education may even cause harm because of the distorted and biased views about premarital contact. It is time to give students more comprehensive and compendious sex education programs that will better prepare them for the future. *8. Though cellphones are necessary for high school students in terms of their safety, they should still be prohibited from use in school. This concept is founded on several reasons, such as disrupting the educational process and facilitating students’ cheating; distracting students by the possibility to access the Internet, social media, or communicate with friends; finally cellphones contribute to the spreading of the social phenomenon known as cyber bullying. *9. The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive. It begins in the east of the Yellow Sea,travels near China’s capital, Beijing, and continues west through numerous provinces. For thousands of miles, it winds like a snake through China’s varied terrain. Smaller walls extend from the main wall.According to the conservative estimates, the Great Wall’s lengths is approximately 2400 miles. Its thickness ranges from 15-30 feet wide, and it reaches in height to about 25 feet. For many centuries, the Great Wall has been considered one of the world’s wonders. (Turnbull &amp; Noon, 2007). *10. Historically, the word Halloween is a contraction from the phrase All Hollows Even, which meant the day before All Hollows Day. It is a Catholic holiday dedicated to the commemoration of saints and martyrs for faith; today, though, we know it more as a holiday of trick-or-treating, scary costumes, and entourage, and funny pranks. Gradually, Halloween has lost its religious connotations, and has turned onto a holiday gladly celebrated by youth and adults across the Western world on October 31. *11. When we take into account how many celebrities used illegal drugs, how unstable their family lives are, and how much crime they commit, we can infer that celebrities should not be celebrated as they are. It is in my opinion that celebrities are worse off than non-celebrities – we should instead honor ourselves with self-esteem, self-confidence and self-reliance. We do not need to look up to famous individuals who can be termed by-and-large as criminals, illegal drug users, and down-and-out family members. Despite the veil of their success, on the whole, they are rather miserable examples of human beings that should not be given the honor they have incurred. *12. It was the 4th of July in blistering Nebraska, America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I went on a picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag, and off I went to collect my friends by way of a bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day. I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn. *13. Antibiotics were invented by Alexander Flemming in 1928 (Diggins). Antibiotics are chemical substances produced by various microorganisms and other living systems, and capable of inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria and viruses. Before the epoch of antibiotics began, there was not much that could be done for patients suffering from different infections, and death rates were not much higher than today. *14. Living in the city is hard, even for those who were born in the industrialized environment of crowded streets, huge supermarkets, crammed subways, and polluting factories. I was born and raised in Dallas, so I know first-hand about heavy traffic and five-level interchange roads. *15. Terrorists cannot continue their actions if they are prosecuted and detained. Grounds for criminal prosecution include UN security Council resolutions and outstanding U.S. indictments (Scheffer, 2001).Circumstances surrounding the attempted use of these grounds to prosecute terrorists activities are not always favorable. * ​</a>

DepEd clarifies blended, distance learning modalities for SY 2020-2021 QUEZON CITY, July 3 (PIA) - The Department of Education (DepEd) clarifies blended and distance learning modality to be implemented this school year, as the agency prepares for a "new method of transmitting learning." In view of the recent information circulating online, DepEd is quick to clarify that online is not the only delivery modality of teaching and learning the department is devising. "Ang pag-aaral ngayong school year ay HINDI LAMANG gagawin online. Inihanda ng DepEd ang iba't ibang paraan ng pag-aaral na aakma sa lahat ng uri ng pamumuhay sa komunidad. Ang self-learning modules (SLM) ay ang pangunahing gagamitin sa pagtuturo," DepEd statement said. Although some parents have been worried for the continued education of their children amid pandemic, DepEd assured that different Education Learning Continuity Plan will be implemented depending on learners' access to technology and the situation they are in. "Some of the lessons will be transmitted through different platforms and some activities will be done at home," Education Secretary Leonor Magtolis Briones said in a virtual press briefing. To avoid face-to-face interactions, DepEd offers blended and distance learning modalities by using printed or digital modules, online learning resources, and radio and TV-based instructions. Distance learning refers to a learning delivery modality where leaming takes place between the teacher and the learners who are geographically remote from each other during instruction.It has three learning modalities: (1) modular distance learning uses self-learning modules that are printed or in digital format; (2) online distance learning uses the Internet in downloading learning materials and uploading homeworks; and (3) Radio/TV based instructions to those who have no Internet connectivity. Meanwhile, blended learning refers to a mix of online distance learning, modular distance learning, and TV/Radio-based Instruction. Homeschooling option is learning in a home-based environment to be facilitated by qualified parents, guardians or tutors who have undergone relevant training. "We need to prepare not only the schools, learners, administrators, and teaching and non-teaching personnel, but also the parents and guardians of the learners," Briones said. These alternative learning methods depend "very heavily on parents and community support to make its Basic Education Learning Continuity Plan (BE-LCP) successful. "Education becomes more and more a shared activity, and we ask the parents and the community and experts and to join us on our effort," Briones said (MTQ/PIA-IDPD).Can this article be considered credible?

                                            I am a student of the National University in Manila. I was only in my first year.
As a student I have an observed appreciation of virtue (CORE
VALUES) Like Respect for the elderly when you say "Po and OOpo" respect for each other
classmate's decision Respect for school law. As a nationalian I was
trustworthy such as not cheating on exams Telling the truth and being diligent.
Because I see other N.U. students cleaning outside the University. As a
student, it's not easy either because you have to pass a lot of exams
memorize and study so that you can pass every science. I see the unity of each

when I was new to this school I got lost and asked my neighbor
student where my classroom immediately he immediately accompanied me to my room and me
thanked him.Even if there is leftovers in a room it doesn’t disappear like that
I witnessed I saw a cellphone charged in the room I did not move it
so did my classmates because they knew they didn’t return it immediately by the owner and
thanked us and the one I dropped my i.d and wallet I was crying before but there was
knocked on our classroom and introduced that he had picked up my i.d and wallet to my delight
I know there are still such people in the world because most people today can be exploited. .
My experience shows that students here can be trusted with ours
school. The teachers here at N.U. are kind and we can’t leave the classroom without
we have deep knowledge or lessons I learn a lot as a good student.
I believe that youth is the hope of the people. I can make it through
study hard, and avoid vice or any evil deeds such as gambling.
I will also strive to be a good example to my fellow youth. I totally believe
that the simple and small ways I do it is a big help in the development of
country I belong to. Whatever hardship I can bear do not despair
every test as a student many people will actually pull you down but confident
only self is needed, diligence, Perseverance and never forget the faith in us
Dear Lord he will help us and
will guide. The year is fast approaching now let's just strive as a good and
diligent students we will not realize that we will be able to finish school and

He had been to visit his friend and had stayed with him for seven years. He saw the children playing in the garden 'What are you doing here?' he cried, and the children ran away. The Giant built a high wall around it. Then the spring came, only in the garden of the Selfish Giant it was still winter. 'I cannot understand why the spring is so late in coming' said the Selfish Giant. One morning the Giant heard some music. It sounded sweet to his ears, 'I believe the spring has come at last,' said the Giant T Then he saw a most wonderful sight. Through a little hole in the wall the children had crept in, and they were sitting in the branches of the trees. And the trees had covered themselves with blossoms, the birds were twittering and the flowers were looking up. 'How selfish I have been!' he said, 'now I know why the spring would not come here. I will knock down the wall, and my garden shall be the children's playground forever.' So he opened the front door and the children, when they saw that the Giant was not wicked any longer, came running and with them came the spring 'It is your garden now, little children, said the Giant, and he knocked down the wall.

Perhaps, since I am a high school student, somebody might say that I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of its beautiful experiences. But despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which, I am sure I will carry with me until my last days. What I am talking about here is my first hike to the mountains. *7. Sexuality education may even cause harm because of the distorted and biased views about premarital contact. It is time to give students more comprehensive and compendious sex education programs that will better prepare them for the future. *8. Though cellphones are necessary for high school students in terms of their safety, they should still be prohibited from use in school. This concept is founded on several reasons, such as disrupting the educational process and facilitating students’ cheating; distracting students by the possibility to access the Internet, social media, or communicate with friends; finally cellphones contribute to the spreading of the social phenomenon known as cyber bullying. *9. The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive. It begins in the east of the Yellow Sea,travels near China’s capital, Beijing, and continues west through numerous provinces. For thousands of miles, it winds like a snake through China’s varied terrain. Smaller walls extend from the main wall.According to the conservative estimates, the Great Wall’s lengths is approximately 2400 miles. Its thickness ranges from 15-30 feet wide, and it reaches in height to about 25 feet. For many centuries, the Great Wall has been considered one of the world’s wonders. (Turnbull &amp; Noon, 2007). *10. Historically, the word Halloween is a contraction from the phrase All Hollows Even, which meant the day before All Hollows Day. It is a Catholic holiday dedicated to the commemoration of saints and martyrs for faith; today, though, we know it more as a holiday of trick-or-treating, scary costumes, and entourage, and funny pranks. Gradually, Halloween has lost its religious connotations, and has turned onto a holiday gladly celebrated by youth and adults across the Western world on October 31. *11. When we take into account how many celebrities used illegal drugs, how unstable their family lives are, and how much crime they commit, we can infer that celebrities should not be celebrated as they are. It is in my opinion that celebrities are worse off than non-celebrities – we should instead honor ourselves with self-esteem, self-confidence and self-reliance. We do not need to look up to famous individuals who can be termed by-and-large as criminals, illegal drug users, and down-and-out family members. Despite the veil of their success, on the whole, they are rather miserable examples of human beings that should not be given the honor they have incurred. *12. It was the 4th of July in blistering Nebraska, America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I went on a picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag, and off I went to collect my friends by way of a bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day. I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn. *13. Antibiotics were invented by Alexander Flemming in 1928 (Diggins). Antibiotics are chemical substances produced by various microorganisms and other living systems, and capable of inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria and viruses. Before the epoch of antibiotics began, there was not much that could be done for patients suffering from different infections, and death rates were not much higher than today. *14. Living in the city is hard, even for those who were born in the industrialized environment of crowded streets, huge supermarkets, crammed subways, and polluting factories. I was born and raised in Dallas, so I know first-hand about heavy traffic and five-level interchange roads. *15. Terrorists cannot continue their actions if they are prosecuted and detained. Grounds for criminal prosecution include UN security Council resolutions and outstanding U.S. indictments (Scheffer, 2001).Circumstances surrounding the attempted use of these grounds to prosecute terrorists activities are not always favorable. * ​</h2><br />

DepEd clarifies blended, distance learning modalities for SY 2020-2021 QUEZON CITY, July 3 (PIA) - The Department of Education (DepEd) clarifies blended and distance learning modality to be implemented this school year, as the agency prepares for a "new method of transmitting learning." In view of the recent information circulating online, DepEd is quick to clarify that online is not the only delivery modality of teaching and learning the department is devising. "Ang pag-aaral ngayong school year ay HINDI LAMANG gagawin online. Inihanda ng DepEd ang iba't ibang paraan ng pag-aaral na aakma sa lahat ng uri ng pamumuhay sa komunidad. Ang self-learning modules (SLM) ay ang pangunahing gagamitin sa pagtuturo," DepEd statement said. Although some parents have been worried for the continued education of their children amid pandemic, DepEd assured that different Education Learning Continuity Plan will be implemented depending on learners' access to technology and the situation they are in. "Some of the lessons will be transmitted through different platforms and some activities will be done at home," Education Secretary Leonor Magtolis Briones said in a virtual press briefing. To avoid face-to-face interactions, DepEd offers blended and distance learning modalities by using printed or digital modules, online learning resources, and radio and TV-based instructions. Distance learning refers to a learning delivery modality where leaming takes place between the teacher and the learners who are geographically remote from each other during instruction.It has three learning modalities: (1) modular distance learning uses self-learning modules that are printed or in digital format; (2) online distance learning uses the Internet in downloading learning materials and uploading homeworks; and (3) Radio/TV based instructions to those who have no Internet connectivity. Meanwhile, blended learning refers to a mix of online distance learning, modular distance learning, and TV/Radio-based Instruction. Homeschooling option is learning in a home-based environment to be facilitated by qualified parents, guardians or tutors who have undergone relevant training. "We need to prepare not only the schools, learners, administrators, and teaching and non-teaching personnel, but also the parents and guardians of the learners," Briones said. These alternative learning methods depend "very heavily on parents and community support to make its Basic Education Learning Continuity Plan (BE-LCP) successful. "Education becomes more and more a shared activity, and we ask the parents and the community and experts and to join us on our effort," Briones said (MTQ/PIA-IDPD).Can this article be considered credible?

study hard, and avoid vice or any evil deeds such as gambling.
I will also strive to be a good example to my fellow youth. I totally believe
that the simple and small ways I do it is a big help in the development of
country I belong to. Whatever hardship I can bear do not despair

The Giant built a high wall around it. Then the spring came, only in the garden of the Selfish Giant it was still winter. 'I cannot understand why the spring is so late in coming' said the Selfish Giant. One morning the Giant heard some music. It sounded sweet to his ears, 'I believe the spring has come at last,' said the Giant T Then he saw a most wonderful sight. Through a little hole in the wall the children had crept in, and they were sitting in the branches of the trees.

I will knock down the wall, and my garden shall be the children's playground forever.' So he opened the front door and the children, when they saw that the Giant was not wicked any longer, came running and with them came the spring 'It is your garden now, little children, said the Giant, and he knocked down the wall.
