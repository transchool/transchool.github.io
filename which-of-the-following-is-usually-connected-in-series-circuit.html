The strength of electrical power is shared in ratio to resistance.2. This circuit risks fire in some cases.3. Usually, this circuit is more complicated and more difficult to assemble.4. This circuit uses fewer wires.5. There is more than one pathway in the circuit that electricity can flow through the bulbs.6. If one light goes out, they all go out: as more bulbs are added. they become dimmer.7. This circuit is simple in design and build.8. In this circuit, the different components of a circuit are on separate branches, which giveselectrons several options when travelling around a circuit.9. The bulbs in this circuit are connected one after the other in one chain.10. A break in one pathway does not make all the lights go out because electricity can still flowthrough other pathways.​​</a>

                            13. Distinguish whether the following descriptions is a parallel or series circuit. Write parallel or series.1. The strength of electrical power is shared in ratio to resistance.2. This circuit risks fire in some cases.3. Usually, this circuit is more complicated and more difficult to assemble.4. This circuit uses fewer wires.5. There is more than one pathway in the circuit that electricity can flow through the bulbs.6. If one light goes out, they all go out: as more bulbs are added. they become dimmer.7. This circuit is simple in design and build.8. In this circuit, the different components of a circuit are on separate branches, which giveselectrons several options when travelling around a circuit.9. The bulbs in this circuit are connected one after the other in one chain.10. A break in one pathway does not make all the lights go out because electricity can still flowthrough other pathways.​​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.When power is high, resistance will be low. When power is low, the resistance will be high.</p><p>2.Overloaded electrical outlets, or circuits that supply power to several outlets, is a major cause of residential fires. Overloaded outlets and circuits carry too much electricity, which generates heat in undetectable amounts. The heat causes wear on the internal wiring system and can ignite a fire.</p><p>3.The parallel circuit is difficult to install and repair due to the volume of conducting wires required in the connection. In a series circuit, loads are difficult to control individually.</p><p>4.In order for electrons to flow they need a closed circuit. An electric circuit provides a complete, closed path for electricity. The parts of a circuit consist of a load or resistance; wires; and a switch. The source of energy can be a battery, thermocouple, photocell or an electric generator. The load is the part of the circuit that uses the power. The load of the circuit always offers some resistance to the flow of electrons. As a result energy is convert into heat, light or mechanical energy. The switch is an electric circuit is used to prevent the flow of electrons. This is called an open circuit</p><p>5.A parallel circuit has more than one path for current flow. The number of current paths is determined by the number of load resistors connected in parallel. Total current in a parallel circuit is the sum of the individual branch currents.</p><p>6.One bulb burning out in a series circuit breaks the circuit. In parallel circuits, each light has its own circuit, so all but one light could be burned out, and the last one will still function</p><p>7.A simple circuit is a circuit that contains the three basic components needed for an electric circuit to function. The three basic components are a source of voltage, a conductive path, and a resistor.</p><p>8.In a parallel circuit the different parts of the electric circuit are on several different branches. There are several different paths that electrons can flow. If there is a break in one branch of the circuit electrons can still flow in other branches (see image of parallel circuit)</p><p>9.series circuit</p><p>A series circuit can be constructed by connecting light bulbs in such a manner that there is a single pathway for charge flow; the bulbs are added to the same line with no branching point.</p><p>10.A break in one pathway does not make all the lights go out because electricity can still flow through other pathways.​​</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Thank you Brainliest me plss</p><br />
