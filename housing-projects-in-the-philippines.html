                                            An American scientist has worked out a program to improve the poultry stock in the Philippines by introducing a fine breed from the United States. At great expense, the exotic roosters are distributed to selected farmers in several barrios. The scientist then takes to the field to inspect the progress of the poultry improvement project. Having been informed of the coming visit of so important a personage, one farmer, in keeping with Filipino hospitality, makes preparations to welcome the VIP with the best he could offer. On his arrival at the farmer’s house, the American scientist is treated to a small feast-and on his dinner plate is the prize chicken, fried. The Filipino host feels only the best will suffice for his honored guest and, of course, the exotic bird is the best he has to offer.” What is your reaction here?​</a>

                                            Overcoming Floods in the Philippines: A Story of Climate Change Adaptation and MitigationSta Rosa, Philippines is frequently visited with heavy rains that cause flash floods and severe flooding in the area and nearby cities. The city sits on the edge of Laguna Lake, the largest lake in the Philippines and located just east of its capital city – Manila.Professor Damasa Macandong of the University of the Philippines Institute of Biological Sciences says that climate change is causing stronger typhoons and rains to hit the Philippines. The video, “Overcoming Floods in the Philippines: A story of climate change adaptation and mitigation” presents that the rapid urbanization and industrialization contributed to the flooding problem.Agricultural lands have been paved with impermeable materials to accommodate factories, commercial buildings, and housing projects, and public infrastructures like roads, the video-documentary mentions.Japan’s Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) partnered with the University of the Philippines (UP) Los Baños to help Sta Rosa and neighboring towns to help adapt to increasing threats of flooding.The partnership between the two institutions has led to the Participatory Watershed Land Use Management Project.Through this partnership, the teams were able to combine their expertise to create flood hazard maps of the Sta Rosa watershed.According to Mr. Endo, these hazard maps will help cities understand the present and future threats of flooding.These hazard maps were able to simulate the condition of the watershed in 2025. Simulations show that massive flooding will affect the four cities comprising the watershed.This information allowed local officials to work together and come up with anintegrated approach to address flooding and implement adaptation strategies.Process Questions:1.

                                            Activity 2: WHAT I CAN DO
Philippines is an agricultural country. Farming, fisheries, livestock, and forestry are four agricultural sectors of the country. It exports agricultural products around the globe. However, due to the land expansion for industrial sector, forest lands were reduced, and farming lands were converted to housing projects. Moreover, due to natural calamity, many of the Philippines’ natural resources were destroyed. These factors somehow affected the economy of the country. As a solution-oriented Filipino, you want to propose a way of solving the problem.
Now, using the outline below, write your proposed solution that may help in solving the problem and strengthen our agricultural sector. Make sure to use modal verbs to express five things that you permit to do, five rules that are obligated to be done, and five actions that are prohibited to commit.

                            22. Overcoming Floods in the Philippines: A Story of Climate Change Adaptation and MitigationSta Rosa, Philippines is frequently visited with heavy rains that cause flash floods and severe flooding in the area and nearby cities. The city sits on the edge of Laguna Lake, the largest lake in the Philippines and located just east of its capital city – Manila.Professor Damasa Macandong of the University of the Philippines Institute of Biological Sciences says that climate change is causing stronger typhoons and rains to hit the Philippines. The video, “Overcoming Floods in the Philippines: A story of climate change adaptation and mitigation” presents that the rapid urbanization and industrialization contributed to the flooding problem.Agricultural lands have been paved with impermeable materials to accommodate factories, commercial buildings, and housing projects, and public infrastructures like roads, the video-documentary mentions.Japan’s Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) partnered with the University of the Philippines (UP) Los Baños to help Sta Rosa and neighboring towns to help adapt to increasing threats of flooding.The partnership between the two institutions has led to the Participatory Watershed Land Use Management Project.Through this partnership, the teams were able to combine their expertise to create flood hazard maps of the Sta Rosa watershed.According to Mr. Endo, these hazard maps will help cities understand the present and future threats of flooding.These hazard maps were able to simulate the condition of the watershed in 2025. Simulations show that massive flooding will affect the four cities comprising the watershed.This information allowed local officials to work together and come up with anintegrated approach to address flooding and implement adaptation strategies.Process Questions:1.

                            30. Activity 2: WHAT I CAN DO
Philippines is an agricultural country. Farming, fisheries, livestock, and forestry are four agricultural sectors of the country. It exports agricultural products around the globe. However, due to the land expansion for industrial sector, forest lands were reduced, and farming lands were converted to housing projects. Moreover, due to natural calamity, many of the Philippines’ natural resources were destroyed. These factors somehow affected the economy of the country. As a solution-oriented Filipino, you want to propose a way of solving the problem.
Now, using the outline below, write your proposed solution that may help in solving the problem and strengthen our agricultural sector. Make sure to use modal verbs to express five things that you permit to do, five rules that are obligated to be done, and five actions that are prohibited to commit.
