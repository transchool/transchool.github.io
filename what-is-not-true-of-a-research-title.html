Do not overpromise the results of the paper in the title. 4. The research title presented follows the guide in crafting a research title, "Scientific Abilities of Public High School Students in Ormoc City Senior High School". 5. The set of specific research questions is dependent on the type of quantitative research being performed 6 A researcher may establish limits (delimits) in his/her study based solely on his/her personal preference 7. As much as possible, in making a research title, one must refrain from indicating the year the study has been conducted 8 It is okay to have plenty of biases on the final research because the study is done based on the perspective of the researcher. 9 A descriptive quantitative study uses specific research questions beginning with phrases such as "to what extent" or "how frequent". 10.
