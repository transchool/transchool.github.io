Three common types of validity for researchers and evaluators to consider are content, construct, and criterion validities. 2. Research instrument that consists of a set of questions or other types of prompts that aims to collect information from a respondent. 3. Validity that indicates the extent to which items adequately measure or represent the content of the property or trait that the researcher wishes to measure. 4. It is also called experimentation, is research conducted using a scientific approach using two or more variables. 5. It measures the correlation between scores from one administration of an instrument to another, usually wilhin an interval of 2 to 3 weeks 6. Il is a way to gather data by watching people, events, or noting physical characteristics in their natural setting. 7. It is a tool used to obtain, measure, and analyze data from subjects around the research topic. 8. It involves an interviewer, who coordinates the process of the conversation and asks questions, and an interviewee, who responds to those questions. 9. It refers to the degree to which an instrument yields consistent results, Common measures of reliability include Internal consistency, test-retest, and inter-rater reliabilities. 10. Validity that indicates the extent to which a measurement method accurately represents a construct (e.g..o latent variable or phenomena that can't be measured directly, such as a person's attitude or belief) and produces an observation distinct from that which is produced by a measure of another construct..​</a>

                                            1. It is a process through which the researcher selects a portion orsegment from the population at the center of the researcher's study.2. It is a group of persons or objects that possess some commoncharacteristics that are of interest to the researcher, and about whichthe researcher seeks to learn more.3. It is composed of the entire group of people or objects to which theresearcher wishes to generalize the findings of the study-4. It is the portion of the population to which the researcher has reasonableaccess5. These are individuals or entities which serve as the focus of the study.6. These are individuals or groups of people who actively serve assources of information during data collection.-7. It refers to subjects of the study who are not people.8. It is the science concerned with developing and studyingmethods for collecting, analyzing, interpreting and presentingempirical data9. It is a constant or variable in a function that determines thespecific form of the function but not its general nature.10. It gives every individual in the target population an equalchance of being part of the sample.11. In this sampling, the researcher first divides the population intogroups based on a relevant characteristic and then selectsparticipants within those groups.12. In this sampling, the researcher uses their expert judgment toselect participants that are representative of the population.13.

It is a group of persons or objects that possess some common characteristics that are of interest to the researcher, and about which the researcher seeks to learn more. 3. It is composed of the entire group of people or objects to which the researcher wishes to generalize the findings of the study. 4. It is the portion of the population to which the researcher has reasonable access. 5. These are individuals or entities which serve as the focus of the study. 6. These are individuals or groups of people who actively serve as sources of information during data collection. 7. It refers to subjects of the study who are not people. 8. It is the science concerned with developing and studying methods for collecting, analyzing, interpreting and presenting empirical data. 9. It is a constant or variable in a function that determines the specific form of the function but not its general nature. 10. It gives every individual in the target population an equal chance of being part of the sample. 11. In this sampling, the researcher first divides the population into groups based on a relevant characteristic and then selects participants within those groups. 12. In this sampling, the researcher uses their expert judgment to select participants that are representative of the population. 13. In this sampling, the sample is selected in multiple steps, or stages. 14. It is the most commonly used method of random sampling, whereby you divide the total population by the sample size and arrive at a figure which becomes the sampling interval for selection. 15. In this sampling, the sample selection follows a particular set of conditions and is generally used in studies where the sample needs to be collected based on a specific characteristic of the population.​​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><strong>Attribute</strong><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>In science and research, an attribute is a characteristic of an object (person, thing, etc.).[1] Attributes are closely related to variables. A variable is a logical set of attributes.[1] Variables can "vary" – for example, be high or low.[1] How high, or how low, is determined by the value of the attribute (and in fact, an attribute could be just the word "low" or "high").</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>while an attribute is often intuitive, the variable is the operationalized way in which the attribute is represented for further data processing. ... Values of each variable statistically "vary" (or are distributed) across the variable's domain. A domain is a set of all possible values that a variable is allowed to have.</p><p></p><br />

Three common types of validity for researchers and evaluators to consider are content, construct, and criterion validities. 2. Research instrument that consists of a set of questions or other types of prompts that aims to collect information from a respondent. 3. Validity that indicates the extent to which items adequately measure or represent the content of the property or trait that the researcher wishes to measure. 4. It is also called experimentation, is research conducted using a scientific approach using two or more variables. 5. It measures the correlation between scores from one administration of an instrument to another, usually wilhin an interval of 2 to 3 weeks 6. Il is a way to gather data by watching people, events, or noting physical characteristics in their natural setting. 7. It is a tool used to obtain, measure, and analyze data from subjects around the research topic. 8. It involves an interviewer, who coordinates the process of the conversation and asks questions, and an interviewee, who responds to those questions. 9. It refers to the degree to which an instrument yields consistent results, Common measures of reliability include Internal consistency, test-retest, and inter-rater reliabilities. 10. Validity that indicates the extent to which a measurement method accurately represents a construct (e.g..o latent variable or phenomena that can't be measured directly, such as a person's attitude or belief) and produces an observation distinct from that which is produced by a measure of another construct..​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>1. VALIDITY<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>Validity</strong> is the primary degree to which an idea, end or estimation is all around established and reasonable compares precisely to this present reality. "Legitimate" is gotten from the Latin validus, which means solid. The <strong>validity </strong>of an estimation apparatus is how much the instrument estimates what it professes to quantify. <strong>Validity </strong>depends on the strength of an assortment of various kinds of proof portrayed more meticulously beneath.
</p><p> In psychometrics, validity has a specific application known as test <strong>validity</strong>: "how much proof and hypothesis support the translations of grades.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Validity</strong> is for the most part acknowledged that the idea of logical validity tends to the idea of reality as far as factual measures and as such is an epistemological and philosophical issue just as an issue of estimation. The utilization of the term in rationale is smaller, connecting with the connection between the premises and finish of a contention. In rationale, <strong>validity </strong>alludes to the property of a contention by which in the event that the premises are valid then the reality of the end follows by need.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Validity in research refers to#asap - Brainly.ph

It is a process through which the researcher selects a portion or segment from the population at the center of the researcher's study. 2. It is a group of persons or objects that possess some common characteristics that are of interest to the researcher, and about which the researcher seeks to learn more. 3. It is composed of the entire group of people or objects to which the researcher wishes to generalize the findings of the study. 4. It is the portion of the population to which the researcher has reasonable access. 5. These are individuals or entities which serve as the focus of the study. 6. These are individuals or groups of people who actively serve as sources of information during data collection. 7. It refers to subjects of the study who are not people. 8. It is the science concerned with developing and studying methods for collecting, analyzing, interpreting and presenting empirical data. 9. It is a constant or variable in a function that determines the specific form of the function but not its general nature. 10. It gives every individual in the target population an equal chance of being part of the sample. 11. In this sampling, the researcher first divides the population into groups based on a relevant characteristic and then selects participants within those groups. 12. In this sampling, the researcher uses their expert judgment to select participants that are representative of the population. 13. In this sampling, the sample is selected in multiple steps, or stages. 14. It is the most commonly used method of random sampling, whereby you divide the total population by the sample size and arrive at a figure which becomes the sampling interval for selection. 15. In this sampling, the sample selection follows a particular set of conditions and is generally used in studies where the sample needs to be collected based on a specific characteristic of the population.​​</h2><br />
