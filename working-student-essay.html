                            2. academic performance of working students essay​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Working while in school is a common reality for many students today. With the rising costs of tuition and living expenses, many students are forced to take on part-time or even full-time jobs in order to make ends meet. However, working while in school can have both positive and negative effects on a student's academic performance as well as their overall college experience.</p><p> </p><p>On the positive side, working while in school can provide students with valuable work experience and the opportunity to earn money to pay for their education. This can help students become more financially independent and responsible and also prepare them for the workforce after graduation. Additionally, working can also serve as a motivator for students to perform well academically, as they want to maintain their grades in order to keep their job.</p><p> </p><p>However, working long hours can lead to fatigue and stress, which can negatively impact a student's ability to focus and retain information. Furthermore, working can also lead to less time for studying and completing assignments, which can result in lower grades and a greater risk of failing classes.</p><p> </p><p>Additionally, working students may find it difficult to balance the demands of work and school. They may have to sacrifice sleep or leisure time in order to keep up with their studies. This can lead to burnout and negatively impact their mental and physical well-being. Furthermore, working students may also have a harder time participating in extracurricular activities or building relationships with their classmates, which can make the college experience less enjoyable.</p><p> </p><p>In conclusion, working while in school can have both positive and negative effects on a student's academic performance and overall college experience. Students should strive to find a balance between work and school and prioritize their studies in order to achieve their academic goals. It's important for students to manage their time effectively, communicate with their employer about their school schedule, and seek out academic support services when needed. With the right approach and mindset, working students can successfully balance their responsibilities and achieve academic success.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>try to read kung tama bah HAHA</p><br />

                            3. Why should students proofread their work? Essay​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Proofreading guarantees that the paper is error-free and polished to a professional standard. Proofreading is vital because it may give our writing more force; without it, our work is more likely to include errors. Any writing effort may benefit from proofreading. When students prepare academic papers, proofreading is frequently overlooked. Proofreading is critical for obtaining a scholarship because if a member of the scholarship committee detects errors in the application essay, the desired financial assistance will be lost.</p><p></p><p>( Correct me if I'm wrong!! ) Don't be pressured, study well, and stay hydrated!

We must take all necessary precautions to ensure that the food we consume is safe and virus-free in order to maintain our health and protect ourselves from the fatal illness. By doing this, we assist not only ourselves in avoiding the fatal illness but also our frontline personnel by making their work easier and reducing stress.</p><p>    Healthy diets are essential for maintaining immune systems, despite the fact that neither foods nor dietary supplements can prevent or treat COVID-19 infection. Additionally, healthy eating helps lessen the risk of acquiring other health issues including obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and some forms of cancer. Food safety and sanitation are critical because improperly prepared food can harm the human body from the inside out. We must ensure that the food we consume is nutritious for us since everyone wants to be in good health. There must be no dangerous bacteria, viruses, parasites, poisons, or toxins in the meal. Sanitation and food safety shield customers from serious health risks. To prevent the transmission of hazardous bacteria, regularly clean your hands, your instruments, and the equipment.

                        <p><strong>ESSAY "HOW COMMUNICATION SKILLS CAN HELP US IN LIFE"</strong></p><p><strong>- AT SCHOOL</strong></p><p><strong>- AT WORK</strong></p><p><strong>- IN RELATIONSHIP AND </strong></p><p><strong>- IN SOCIAL INTERACTION</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Communication skills are very important to be applied in various lines of life, both at school, at work, in relationships and in social interactions. </strong>For the sake of realizing learning objectives, communication in learning can simply be interpreted as a process of exchanging ideas and ideas between teachers and students. Therefore, communication in learning must be effective so that it can improve achievement and teaching and learning outcomes. Likewise in the workplace, good communication is important in the workplace because little work is an act in itself. It takes communication to work in a team, and even people working alone must report to their superiors. If you run a business, you must tell your employees what is expected of them. Poor communication leads to errors, failures, and sometimes lawsuits. Effective communication helps prevent these mistakes.</p><p></p><p><strong>No less important is communication in special relationships. </strong>One of the main keys in maintaining the rhythm of a good and healthy relationship is communication. Communication is important to create a sense of belonging and build a feeling of mutual trust in your partner so as not to make the relationship unhealthy and even messy. Good communication is very necessary in a good relationship, it's a love relationship. Many people do not communicate effectively because they are afraid of a response from their partner or because their partner never respects their feelings. Though good communication is a key element in maintaining the stability of a relationship. According to one study conducted in 2018 we can know that conflicts that occur whether they are still in thought or have been formed through physical behavior, then this can create or cause psychological violence either from one party or both parties. In a wider and crucial scope, namely in social interaction. We can find examples of social interaction in everyday life.</p><p></p><p>Social interaction is something that we cannot avoid every day. <strong>Humans are social creatures who interact with other individuals every day.</strong> This social interaction can occur between individuals or groups. The purpose of this reciprocal relationship is to establish friendships, discussions, and collaborations that are applied in social life. One of the characteristics of social interaction is the number of interaction actors more than one or more people. Social interaction occurs when there is communication between social actors using symbols. There are three types of social interactions that exist in our daily lives, namely individual social interaction with individuals, individual social interactions with groups, and group social interactions with groups.</p><p></p><p><strong>Social communication between individuals and individuals</strong>, namely greeting each other and asking how they are passing by neighbors, inviting them to play with their brothers or sisters at home. Another example is a student asking the teacher about the subject matter that has not been understood, father and mother talking together after a long day at work, buyers and traders haggling in the market. Second, the <strong>social communication of individuals with groups</strong>. For example, a resource person gives an explanation at a seminar, a salesperson conducts a cooking demonstration at the social gathering for the neighborhood women, the principal is talking to the students during the ceremony, a teacher is teaching his students in class. Finally, <strong>group communication with the group</strong>. For example, students and college students who carry out real work college work programs provide direction to villagers and inter-class sports competitions.</p><p></p><p>See more about <strong>The Harm Of Interacting With Strangers Online </strong>here:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/2222082</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />
