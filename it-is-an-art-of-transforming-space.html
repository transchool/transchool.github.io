                                            For conventional drawing or painting, artists have always been concerned with creating the impression of room or depth on a flat surface. They use the effects of a single point of view and/or light and shadow to create this illusion— or they can deliberately distort these elements to make abstractions, as in the Cubist style. In conventional sculpture, space is explored in terms of both positive and negative space. The next element of art is the so – called Space. What is space by the way? How is space used for sculpture? Why is the room depicted in painting? Why is space different from space in life in art?Many contemporary artists deal with space by concentrating on real space— the dimensions of a house, the spaces that we travel through in the city or in the natural world, the boundless spaces of the sky or the virtual space of the Internet. We work with fine-art or industrial materials— from wood and stone to steel and plastic— to frame space or to create space-filling work. Materials such as electrical lighting, film, video, or digital media can also transform, document, or create space. Viewers may be surrounded by art, or they can contribute to a concentrated experience or a perception of a real space. When an artist creates a piece of work for a room or a specific space, it is called installation art. Most installations are temporary and often require multiple senses, such as sight, sound and smell.​</a>

I am certain, that you do appreciate Arts, may be not in that traditional concept of it, but do you appreciate Fine food? Beauty? There must be a form of Art that you do enjoy and appreciate, and it is not necessarily Fine Arts or Contemporary Arts in paintings or sculpture, but perhaps Architecture? Fashion? Design? Furniture? Cinematography? Music? Art has many different expressive forms. The start to understand or appreciate any art form is to find beauty in it that will move your heart. Think about what makes you happy or interested in with the passion in your chest? Perhaps you like to collect an old vinyls or comic books? These are the forms of Art. Julia Child had no a clue on what is she going to do with her life until she turned 50 years old, and then she realised that she is passionate about food and cooking and she has decided to share her passion with the rest of the world. One day you might accept your passion and identify how your own Art form passion can be shared with the rest of the world bringing more joy into your life and those many others, then it will become natural to understand and appreciate the passions of others and their Art Forms.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>As an adult, there is really only one way to actually learny book in the world, watch dvds, youtube videos, yada yada yada.

                        <strong>Answer:</strong> <strong>Casting</strong>. Similar to modelling, this technique also requires the use of a mould. The main difference with casting is that the resulting sculptures are generally made from combinations of metals. Bronze, for example, is an alloy of tin and copper, and is commonly used in sculptures as it is strong and durable. <strong>Installation Art</strong> is an art form that requires a suited site for transformation of spaces to a desired effect. They are created and installed only in the space intended for it in a certain period of time and are dismantled and some are burned after it served its purpose.  <p></p><p></p>#CarryOnLearning <br />

                            25. For conventional drawing or painting, artists have always been concerned with creating the impression of room or depth on a flat surface. They use the effects of a single point of view and/or light and shadow to create this illusion— or they can deliberately distort these elements to make abstractions, as in the Cubist style. In conventional sculpture, space is explored in terms of both positive and negative space. The next element of art is the so – called Space. What is space by the way? How is space used for sculpture? Why is the room depicted in painting? Why is space different from space in life in art?Many contemporary artists deal with space by concentrating on real space— the dimensions of a house, the spaces that we travel through in the city or in the natural world, the boundless spaces of the sky or the virtual space of the Internet. We work with fine-art or industrial materials— from wood and stone to steel and plastic— to frame space or to create space-filling work. Materials such as electrical lighting, film, video, or digital media can also transform, document, or create space. Viewers may be surrounded by art, or they can contribute to a concentrated experience or a perception of a real space. When an artist creates a piece of work for a room or a specific space, it is called installation art. Most installations are temporary and often require multiple senses, such as sight, sound and smell.​</h2><br />
