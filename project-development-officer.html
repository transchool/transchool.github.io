                                            MANILA - A regulator has given its final approval to the proposal to develop the Wawa Dam in Rodriguez, Rizal as a new water source for the Metro Manila, the project's proponent said on Monday. WawaJVCO, the joint venture between ports magnate Enrique Razon’s Prime Infra and businessman Oscar Violago’s San Lorenzo Ruiz Builders Group, said the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System approved the Wawa Bulk Water Supply Project during the Nov. 14 meeting of the MWSS Board. The project, which is a private arrangement between Manila Water and WawaJVCo, is expected to generate at least 80 million liters per day (mld) for Manila Water by 2021, and over 500 mld by 2025. Prime Infra said it hoped to break ground on the project next year. MWSS Chairman Reynaldo Velasco said he hoped other government agencies would soon issue permits for the project. Razon first announced the project in April as water service interruptions affected large parts of Metro Manila. The project was initially approved by the MWSS in May, but still had to hurdle a legal review by the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel (OGCC). The MWSS said the OGCC approved the project last Nov. 7. Wawa Dam used to supply the bulk of Metro Manila's water needs before Angat Dam went into service.　what do your opinion on this matters? ​</a>

1. This organization has presumably overlooked the economic progress that coal-
based power could bring to the province.
2. It is important to notice the strong statements of urgency of the author which is
an implication that these coal-based projects in the province bring destruction to the
environment.
3. I feel that there is a need for the offices called upon to take an action because
the environmental problems we experience now may be worsened if these coal-projects
will be pushed through.
4. Generally, this type of appeal hampers the potential development that the co
based projects could give to the community.

As an operator in a medium sized company, you were instructed to bring forth all remaining stocks with slight damages to the management’s office. Upon checking, all these products may not be safe to use especially in the long run. Your supervisor views the products as having only very minimal impairments.

One of its current projects involves the construction of recreational facilities for
the city’s residents. Suppose you were one of the engineers of the said project and your job was to renovate/improve the walkway, patio, and driveway. After your ocular inspection, you noticed that a rectangular floor measuring (10 m by 14 m) needed to be fixed. Likewise, your plan is to put brick paves to ensure that the walkway is strong and durable.
Consider the following:
1. Each piece of brick pave is a square with an edge of 50 cm. How many pieces of brick paves will be needed to cover the rectangular floor that needs fixing?
2. If one bag of adhesive cement for brick paves can cover 10 sq. m, how many bags of adhesive cement will be needed?
3. Make a model to illustrate the situation with appropriate mathematical
solutions.</a>

                            10. MANILA - A regulator has given its final approval to the proposal to develop the Wawa Dam in Rodriguez, Rizal as a new water source for the Metro Manila, the project's proponent said on Monday. WawaJVCO, the joint venture between ports magnate Enrique Razon’s Prime Infra and businessman Oscar Violago’s San Lorenzo Ruiz Builders Group, said the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System approved the Wawa Bulk Water Supply Project during the Nov. 14 meeting of the MWSS Board. The project, which is a private arrangement between Manila Water and WawaJVCo, is expected to generate at least 80 million liters per day (mld) for Manila Water by 2021, and over 500 mld by 2025. Prime Infra said it hoped to break ground on the project next year. MWSS Chairman Reynaldo Velasco said he hoped other government agencies would soon issue permits for the project. Razon first announced the project in April as water service interruptions affected large parts of Metro Manila. The project was initially approved by the MWSS in May, but still had to hurdle a legal review by the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel (OGCC). The MWSS said the OGCC approved the project last Nov. 7. Wawa Dam used to supply the bulk of Metro Manila's water needs before Angat Dam went into service.　what do your opinion on this matters? ​</h2><br />

1. This organization has presumably overlooked the economic progress that coal-

2. It is important to notice the strong statements of urgency of the author which is
an implication that these coal-based projects in the province bring destruction to the
environment.
3. I feel that there is a need for the offices called upon to take an action because
the environmental problems we experience now may be worsened if these coal-projects
will be pushed through.

Your City Government Projects Office provides guidance and training for local governments, including municipalities or regional mobility authorities in the development of transportation projects. One of its current projects involves the construction of recreational facilities for
the city’s residents. Suppose you were one of the engineers of the said project and your job was to renovate/improve the walkway, patio, and driveway. After your ocular inspection, you noticed that a rectangular floor measuring (10 m by 14 m) needed to be fixed. Likewise, your plan is to put brick paves to ensure that the walkway is strong and durable.
Consider the following:
1. Each piece of brick pave is a square with an edge of 50 cm. How many pieces of brick paves will be needed to cover the rectangular floor that needs fixing?
2. If one bag of adhesive cement for brick paves can cover 10 sq. m, how many bags of adhesive cement will be needed?
3. Make a model to illustrate the situation with appropriate mathematical
solutions.</h2><br />

We hope the last stages of the program." - The program allows members to settle their liabilities without paying penalties. - 13 brand new dump trucks and eight brand new pick-up trucks were acquired by city hall for road maintennaces, flood control and urban development projects. - Manila Mayor Lito Atienza turned over to the City Engineer's Office yesterday - The turnover rites was a simple one at the Manila City Hall quadrangle - Atienza instructed City Engineer Armand Andres to maximize the use of the new trucks to speed up completion of ongoing city development projects - The trucks should also be made available during emergency situations including ferring stranded commuters in flood-probe areas and rescuing residents in low-lying districts during typhoons - All trucks were bought locally amounting to P29.5 million.​</h2><br />
                        <strong>Answer:</strong>SSS President and Chief Executive Officer Emmanuel F. Dooc said the LRP, which was offered starting April 2, already condoned more than P3.35 billion worth of penalties from 200,960 availees in April to end-June period.“When we launched the second LRP in April, we expected to attract 250,000 availees but to our surprise, we’ve already reached the 200,000-mark in just three months of LRP implementation and we still have nearly three months to accept more LRP applications,” Dooc said.”LRP is serving its purpose of providing immense financial relief to our members by giving them the opportunity to clean up their loan records. So I’m encouraging all member-borrowers with past-due short-term loans to avail of the program on or before October 1,” Dooc added.The program covers all member-borrowers who have past due loans such as Salary Loan, Emergency Loan, Educational Loan (old), Study Now Pay Later Plan, Voc-Tech Loans, Y2K Loans and Investments Incentive Loan. Member-borrower must be residing or working in a calamity/disaster-stricken area declared by the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC), or in the case of Ondoy, by the National Government.To qualify, the loan must be past due for at least six months from the start of the second implementation of LRP. The member must be living or working in a declared calamity area as of the date of the disaster. Members granted with any final benefit claim prior to the LRP availment period and those who committed fraud against the SSS are disqualified from the program.“This is to remind our members that they are no longer qualified to avail of the second LRP if they have previously availed of the first LRP in 2016,” Dooc noted.To apply for LRP with penalty condonation, member-borrowers should bring their duly accomplished application form, Letter of Authority (LOA) if will be filed by an authorized representative, and valid identification cards.Dooc also reminded its members that all SSS branches are now accepting scanned copies of LOA received through email by representatives of member-borrowers applying for the LRP.“Authorized representatives are required to submit the email request of the member-borrower, scanned copies of LOA and member-borrower’s two valid IDs, photocopy of their two valid IDs and clear copy of email showing both the sender’s and recipient’s email address,” Dooc concluded.<strong>Explanation:</strong>i hope its help pa brainliest po tysm<br />
