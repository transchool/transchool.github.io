YES NO A supposed dead whale' was seen on the shores of Naic, Cavite on May 11, 2017, which was in fact an art installation. What looked like a dead whale from afar was really made of plastic waste up close. The original Dead Whale installation in Cavite, a collaboration between a non-governmental environmental organization and Dentsu Jayme Syſu led by Creative Director Biboy Royong, was displayed for only three days and was dismantled immediately to prevent the plastic waste used from going into the ocean. Mounting the Dead Whale for a longer period of time will give more people a chance to experience what it might feel like to encounter, or be confronted by, a decomposing whale victimized by the increasing presence of plastic in our oceans. 2.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Most Striking Encounter with Arts</p><p>*Paintings: An art that has something that interests you in person on one of a million ways and leaves a great impression. This may be a work of art that challenges you and then makes you think about it for days, or one that seduces you and leaves you with pleasant feelings for days.</p><p>*Sculptures: Sculptures are designed to be viewed in the round, allowing you to shift your perspective as you interact with them.</p><p>*Photographs: Emotion is what helps a person connect with a photograph, or any work of art, if that emotion is present in the person. Happiness and peace, grief and sorrow are some of the simpler emotions to deal with because they are universally felt by everyone on the earth at some point.</p><br />
