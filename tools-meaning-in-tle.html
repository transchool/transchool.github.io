2. Machine/Power tools are tools manipulated by our hands and with the use
of electrical energy such as: electric drill, grinding wheels, vacuum cleaner
and others.
3. Pneumatic tools are tools or instruments activated by air pressure.
Pneumatic tools are designed around three basic devices: the air cylinder, the
vane motor, and the sprayer.
A. Hand tools
They include screwdrivers, hammers, pliers, wrenches and pullers.
1. Screwdrivers are used to drive, or turn screws. The common type has a single flat blade
for driving screws with slotted heads. The other type has the cross slotted head.
1. Hammers are mostly used tools in the shop. They should be gripped at the end of the

3. Wrenches are used to turn screws, nuts and bolts with hexagonal heads. ―Hexagonal‖
means six-sided. A variety of wrenches are used in the shop.
4. Pullers are used to remove gears and hubs from shafts, bushings from blind holes, and
cylinders’ liners from the engine blocks.

2. Grinding tool can be either bench-mounted or installed on a pedestal. They may either
have a grinding wheel, view wheel, or two grinding wheels. 
 3. Vacuum cleaner is used for cleaning the floor and car interiors after service. C. Pneumatic tools
1. Pneumatic Torque Wrench. This wrench uses compressed air to quickly and powerfully
turn nuts, bolts, and other objects 
.2. Air chisel uses reciprocating motion to drive a cutting hammering tool. An air hammer
drives a chisel to cut off a nut that has frozen to a stud. It can be used with a variety of 3. Air drill is lighter than a comparable electric drill. Repeatedly stalling or overloading
does not damage or overheat the air drill. 
4. Air racket uses the sockets and attachments from a standard socket set.
5. Pneumatic floor jack uses compressed air to flow into the jack cylinder and causes the
ram to extend and raise the vehicle.

2. Machine/Power tools are tools manipulated by our hands and with the use
of electrical energy such as: electric drill, grinding wheels, vacuum cleaner
and others.
3. Pneumatic tools are tools or instruments activated by air pressure.
Pneumatic tools are designed around three basic devices: the air cylinder, the
vane motor, and the sprayer.
A. Hand tools
They include screwdrivers, hammers, pliers, wrenches and pullers.
1. Screwdrivers are used to drive, or turn screws. The common type has a single flat blade
for driving screws with slotted heads. The other type has the cross slotted head.
1. Hammers are mostly used tools in the shop. They should be gripped at the end of the
handle.
2. Pliers are specified types of adjustable wrenches. The two legs move on a pivot so that
items of various sizes can be gripped.
3. Wrenches are used to turn screws, nuts and bolts with hexagonal heads. ―Hexagonal‖
means six-sided. A variety of wrenches are used in the shop.
4. Pullers are used to remove gears and hubs from shafts, bushings from blind holes, and
cylinders’ liners from the engine blocks.
B. Machine/Power Tools
1. Electric drill has an electric motor that drives a chuck. The chuck has jaws that can be
opened and then closed to grip a drill kit. 
2. Grinding tool can be either bench-mounted or installed on a pedestal. They may either
have a grinding wheel, view wheel, or two grinding wheels. 
 3. Vacuum cleaner is used for cleaning the floor and car interiors after service. C. Pneumatic tools
1. Pneumatic Torque Wrench. This wrench uses compressed air to quickly and powerfully
turn nuts, bolts, and other objects 
.2. Air chisel uses reciprocating motion to drive a cutting hammering tool. An air hammer
drives a chisel to cut off a nut that has frozen to a stud. It can be used with a variety of 3. Air drill is lighter than a comparable electric drill. Repeatedly stalling or overloading
does not damage or overheat the air drill. 
4. Air racket uses the sockets and attachments from a standard socket set.
5. Pneumatic floor jack uses compressed air to flow into the jack cylinder and causes the
ram to extend and raise the vehicle.
