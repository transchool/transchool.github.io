The Parable of the Rainbow Colors 
Juan M. Flavier
It all started as innocent statements by each of the colors. No attempt was made by anyone to denigrate the others. There was even an element of restraint and humility.
 But as time went on, the colors declarations became stronger and haughty with an overtone which tended to out down the other colors. Their claim became very explicit as to who was the best color. 
It reached the point when the colors were actually quarrelling. 
Said the color RED, “I am the brightest! for red is the most striking. Why? Life-sustaining blood is colored red. I represent courage and bravery. Even love symbols like the heart and the roses presented are red in color.”
The color YELLOW retorted, “What can be brighter than my yellow exemplified by the sun? I am the color of gaiety and of warmth. Without me, only the eye-glaring ones remains.”
What an outlandish claim! Interposed the color ORANGE. “Sunrise is orange, not
yellow. I am more important because I represent health and strength. Look at the ripened fruits and vegetables, they are predominantly orange.”
Well, if you are talking about vegetables and leaves, you are referring to my color, declared the color GREEN. “I am the symbol of life. All that thrives in the fields and the forests is the greenery I provide. I am the most important color.”
The color BLUE could not help it anymore so it shouted, “What can be more expansive than the skies and the seas? Do you forget that the farthest skies and the deepest seas are blue? I represent patriotism. I stand for the depth of feelings and extensive spaces.”
The color INDIGO came out with a statement, “You talk about wide areas. I hope you realized the largest area in the world is silence and I represent that dimension with my color. It means thoughtfulness. It is prayer expressed in the deepest of feelings.”
“Aha! You forget the pomp of royalty and power is VIOLET, shouted the color. I am wisdom and authority. What can be more overwhelming?”
Suddenly, the rain interrupted the contentious exchange of arguments. “Yes, you all have your unique features. But all of you have a special role. And more importantly, you need each other to give the mix of colors for beauty. Because of your quarrelling. . . God has asked me to inform you of a decision. From now on, you will not be seen separately. When it rains, a strip of colors will appear in the sky. You will all appear together. You will be called a rainbow. You will then represent cooperation and hope. The rainbow in the sky.”
With that, the rain disappeared.
Task 5 Analyze the situations based on the “Parable of Rainbow Colors” written by Juan M. Flavier. Choose which color of the rainbow shows the following scenario in our lives. 
1. The Frontliners are doing their bests to save lives. 
2. A soldier is dying in a battle because of love for country. 
3. A journalist has the power to change someone’s way of thinking. 
4. The farmers are very happy because of the good harvest this year. 
5. There are volunteers who planted plants and trees to save our forests.

The comparison of the lexical and grammatical patterns and their appropriateness in academic writing is illustrated with the help of Word Smith tool 3. Students are often required to summarize scholarly journal articles or to base reviews or critiques or research papers on scholarly sources, all of which require acts of summary. Summary is one of the most prominent features of academic writing because it gives writers access to the ides of others. You will find the most of the academic writing you do will respond to or be based on the ideas the writing- of others​</a>

                                            Read the following texts. Identify each one as coherent and cohesive or cohesive but not coherent. Write your answer on yellow paper. 1. My sister is addicted to computer games. She spends almost half of her allowance in playing computer games at internet café. She said it makes her happy and relieves her stress. Despite her pleas, I decided to cut her allowance so she will not have enough money to spend in playing computer game. 2. Klein reached the top of the mountain. He likes mountain bikes. He also bikes around the town every now and then. Our town is such a peaceful and beautiful place. I feel so beautiful everyday. Everyday should be taken as a chance to start anew. 3. Studying is so fun for me. It is not very interesting for most students but it is for me. I love waking up early every morning with a thought that I will be learning a lot of new things again. I especially enjoy attending math class because I like challenging myself to solve problems that I know I have difficulty with. I sincerely hope that my fellow students will learn to appreciate how fun studying is much as I do, so that going to school will no longer be a burden for them. 4. Writing is not one of my interests. I always have a hard time expressing myself through writing. Nevertheless, I am open to learning new things which is why I am allotting extra time in reading books about writing. I get frustrated most of the time when I feel like I do not make any improvements at all in writing despite exerting so much effort. In spite of this, I know that I should not give up until I finally turn this weakness into one of my strengths. 5. Myles bought a new phone. She likes buying new things. Shopping is one of her favorite pastimes. Pasta and desserts are also her favorite. She does not like overcooked pasta though. There was one time when she tried cooking pasta. The result was not just overcooked, but it was burnt.​</a>

                                            interpret by using the elements of a short story                The Diary of the Girl Dear Diary.          It was a very cold winter when the breath of the light of home was taken back by the Giver of life. I was out in the dark during that time. The moon keeps on smiling but suddenly it cried. I have cried out so loud from the envelope of love and caress. At the same time, the deafening silence of the great woman cornered the four sides of the white room. Together with the men and women in white, is the pillar of home. Yes, he was left alone, just with me, with that day of tears, sorrow and melancholy. But he, knowing I am the cause of the decease of his dearly love, his flower of delight since high school of loyalty and honesty, with love and tenderness, with sacrifice and devotion, he poses that smile of inspiring and motivating love as I was going out of the school. It seems he always misses me after eight hours stay inside that highly-cost home of human knowledge and wisdom. He holds and carries me in his strong arms as he turns me once or twice around. He kisses me with his beard that tickles my thin skin. But the feeling is different. I love it. Yes, he was left alone with only a piece of land inherited from his deceased parents (which was sold when I was out to light) since my mom's family defied him for his indigence and misfortune. He was alone. He works nine or ten hours a day in that factory of not-so-popular cloth trade. His pay is just a little. However, his money is like abundant leaves. I was wondering how he pays our rent, our water, our food, my ice cream, my Barbie, my tiny thick uniform, my candies, my chocolates and my pretty toys. Sometimes, I ask the air, "Where on earth my dad get lots of money?" Isn't it surprising? Yes it is. It is really surprising that my dad pretends to be happy though I am the cause of his heartaches when mom died. Yes he is rich because he pretends to be someone because he wants me to be happy at all times. He pretends not to be tired because he wants me to be good at school. He makes me laugh because he does not want me to be lonely. And most of all, he wants me to smile because when I do, his pain will go away. Sometimes, he holds his stomach. I know it is empty for the whole day. How I wish that time must fly so fast so I could accompany him to bear his burdens. I knew it then. I knew that his joy is me. He sacrifices, he lies and he pretends because I am the only fruit of his sweet long love from the great woman whom I owe my life- my mom. How touching for a little girl like me with five and four years in this world! Though innocent, I feel the warm caress and tender touch, sweetest smile and eyes so bright of my dad. This is Sharina, leaving you of the greetings, "Happy Father's Day! Love your dad unconditionally!"​</a>

                            6. Task 4 Read and Enjoy
The Parable of the Rainbow Colors 
Juan M. Flavier
It all started as innocent statements by each of the colors. No attempt was made by anyone to denigrate the others. There was even an element of restraint and humility.
 But as time went on, the colors declarations became stronger and haughty with an overtone which tended to out down the other colors. Their claim became very explicit as to who was the best color. 
It reached the point when the colors were actually quarrelling. 
Said the color RED, “I am the brightest! for red is the most striking. Why? Life-sustaining blood is colored red. I represent courage and bravery. Even love symbols like the heart and the roses presented are red in color.”
The color YELLOW retorted, “What can be brighter than my yellow exemplified by the sun? I am the color of gaiety and of warmth. Without me, only the eye-glaring ones remains.”
What an outlandish claim! Interposed the color ORANGE. “Sunrise is orange, not
yellow. I am more important because I represent health and strength. Look at the ripened fruits and vegetables, they are predominantly orange.”
Well, if you are talking about vegetables and leaves, you are referring to my color, declared the color GREEN. “I am the symbol of life. All that thrives in the fields and the forests is the greenery I provide. I am the most important color.”
The color BLUE could not help it anymore so it shouted, “What can be more expansive than the skies and the seas? Do you forget that the farthest skies and the deepest seas are blue? I represent patriotism. I stand for the depth of feelings and extensive spaces.”
The color INDIGO came out with a statement, “You talk about wide areas. I hope you realized the largest area in the world is silence and I represent that dimension with my color. It means thoughtfulness. It is prayer expressed in the deepest of feelings.”
“Aha! You forget the pomp of royalty and power is VIOLET, shouted the color. I am wisdom and authority. What can be more overwhelming?”
Suddenly, the rain interrupted the contentious exchange of arguments. “Yes, you all have your unique features. But all of you have a special role. And more importantly, you need each other to give the mix of colors for beauty. Because of your quarrelling. . . God has asked me to inform you of a decision. From now on, you will not be seen separately. When it rains, a strip of colors will appear in the sky. You will all appear together. You will be called a rainbow. You will then represent cooperation and hope. The rainbow in the sky.”
With that, the rain disappeared.
Task 5 Analyze the situations based on the “Parable of Rainbow Colors” written by Juan M. Flavier. Choose which color of the rainbow shows the following scenario in our lives. 
1. The Frontliners are doing their bests to save lives. 
2. A soldier is dying in a battle because of love for country. 
3. A journalist has the power to change someone’s way of thinking. 
4. The farmers are very happy because of the good harvest this year. 
5. There are volunteers who planted plants and trees to save our forests.

The comparison of the lexical and grammatical patterns and their appropriateness in academic writing is illustrated with the help of Word Smith tool 3. Students are often required to summarize scholarly journal articles or to base reviews or critiques or research papers on scholarly sources, all of which require acts of summary. Summary is one of the most prominent features of academic writing because it gives writers access to the ides of others.

                            15. Read the following texts. Identify each one as coherent and cohesive or cohesive but not coherent. Write your answer on yellow paper. 1. My sister is addicted to computer games. She spends almost half of her allowance in playing computer games at internet café. She said it makes her happy and relieves her stress. Despite her pleas, I decided to cut her allowance so she will not have enough money to spend in playing computer game. 2. Klein reached the top of the mountain. He likes mountain bikes. He also bikes around the town every now and then. Our town is such a peaceful and beautiful place. I feel so beautiful everyday. Everyday should be taken as a chance to start anew. 3. Studying is so fun for me. It is not very interesting for most students but it is for me. I love waking up early every morning with a thought that I will be learning a lot of new things again. I especially enjoy attending math class because I like challenging myself to solve problems that I know I have difficulty with. I sincerely hope that my fellow students will learn to appreciate how fun studying is much as I do, so that going to school will no longer be a burden for them. 4. Writing is not one of my interests. I always have a hard time expressing myself through writing. Nevertheless, I am open to learning new things which is why I am allotting extra time in reading books about writing. I get frustrated most of the time when I feel like I do not make any improvements at all in writing despite exerting so much effort. In spite of this, I know that I should not give up until I finally turn this weakness into one of my strengths. 5. Myles bought a new phone. She likes buying new things. Shopping is one of her favorite pastimes. Pasta and desserts are also her favorite. She does not like overcooked pasta though. There was one time when she tried cooking pasta. The result was not just overcooked, but it was burnt.​</h2><br />

                            24. interpret by using the elements of a short story                The Diary of the Girl Dear Diary.          It was a very cold winter when the breath of the light of home was taken back by the Giver of life. I was out in the dark during that time. The moon keeps on smiling but suddenly it cried. I have cried out so loud from the envelope of love and caress. At the same time, the deafening silence of the great woman cornered the four sides of the white room. Together with the men and women in white, is the pillar of home. Yes, he was left alone, just with me, with that day of tears, sorrow and melancholy. But he, knowing I am the cause of the decease of his dearly love, his flower of delight since high school of loyalty and honesty, with love and tenderness, with sacrifice and devotion, he poses that smile of inspiring and motivating love as I was going out of the school. It seems he always misses me after eight hours stay inside that highly-cost home of human knowledge and wisdom. He holds and carries me in his strong arms as he turns me once or twice around. He kisses me with his beard that tickles my thin skin. But the feeling is different. I love it. Yes, he was left alone with only a piece of land inherited from his deceased parents (which was sold when I was out to light) since my mom's family defied him for his indigence and misfortune. He was alone. He works nine or ten hours a day in that factory of not-so-popular cloth trade. His pay is just a little. However, his money is like abundant leaves. I was wondering how he pays our rent, our water, our food, my ice cream, my Barbie, my tiny thick uniform, my candies, my chocolates and my pretty toys. Sometimes, I ask the air, "Where on earth my dad get lots of money?" Isn't it surprising? Yes it is. It is really surprising that my dad pretends to be happy though I am the cause of his heartaches when mom died. Yes he is rich because he pretends to be someone because he wants me to be happy at all times. He pretends not to be tired because he wants me to be good at school. He makes me laugh because he does not want me to be lonely. And most of all, he wants me to smile because when I do, his pain will go away. Sometimes, he holds his stomach. I know it is empty for the whole day. How I wish that time must fly so fast so I could accompany him to bear his burdens. I knew it then. I knew that his joy is me. He sacrifices, he lies and he pretends because I am the only fruit of his sweet long love from the great woman whom I owe my life- my mom. How touching for a little girl like me with five and four years in this world! Though innocent, I feel the warm caress and tender touch, sweetest smile and eyes so bright of my dad. This is Sharina, leaving you of the greetings, "Happy Father's Day! Love your dad unconditionally!"​</h2><br />
