                                            Directions: Identify what Literary Criticism is applicable to the following. (STRUCTURALISM, MORAL CRITICISM, MARXISM, FEMINISM, HISTORICAL APPROACH, READER-RESPONSE APPROACH)____________________1. The bible teaches us the value of forgiveness through the parable of The Prodigal Son, wherein the son asked for his inheritance from his father and left. He wasted all his inheritance and came back to his father empty-handed. He expected that he would have to beg for his father to take him back despite what he did. To his surprise, he was warmly welcomed by his father without hesitation. He was forgiven despite all his mistakes.____________________2. In the story of Cinderella, the Prince came from a rich family of royalties while Cinderella is just a poor commoner. Cinderella’s stepmother believes that she is not fit for the Prince because they live in two separate worlds of the rich and the poor.____________________3. The novel, Animal Farm, written by George Orwell was published in 1945. This novel is an allegory - even though it is set on a farm and stars a cast of farm animals, it reflects the events of the Russian revolution of 1917. The animals are all clever representations of Russian politicians, voters and workers. Orwell used the novel to make his opinions on Russian leaders. He couldn’t blatantly attack these leaders in his writings because of the censorship that British Media imposed during the 1940s just to get support from Soviet Union, so he allegorically criticized them using The Animal Farm. During the censorship, anti-Stalin and anti-Soviet writings were put on hold and were never published in Great Britain.____________________4. On June 17, 2018, workers at NurtiAsia Philippines went on a strike against low wages and unhealthy working conditions. The workers also alleged that NutriAsia practiced contractualization -- extending regular employment agreements to less than 10 percent of its 1,400-person workforce. The protest resulted in violent dispersal of the workers and on July 5 of the same year, Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) ordered NutriAsia to regularize 80 contractual workers.____________________5. The Autobiography of Veronica Franco, an Italian poet and a courtesan (sex worker in Renaissance Italy) talks about her struggles as a woman to gain a spot in the world of literature dominated mostly by men of nobility. She was labeled as an ‘honest courtesan’ for she fully disclosed in her autobiography her sexual relationships with intellectuals, noble men, and even with Kings. She used her social status as a courtesan to establish a name in literature because at that time, women did not have much voice in the society. What Veronica did was discuss and expose sexual issues, and for that, she was attacked by some of her male acquaintances for her boldness because men expected women to be reserved during that era.​</a>

                                            The Rat Trap (Author Unknown)A rat looked through a crack in the wall to see the farmer and his wife opening a package. What food might it contain? He was aghast to discover that it was a rat trap. Retreating to the barnyard the rat proclaimed the warning: "There's a rat trap in the house, a rat trap in the house!"The chicken clucked and scratched, raised her head and said, "Excuse me, Mr. Rat, I can tell this is a grave concern to you, but it is of no consequence to me. I cannot be bothered by it." The rat turned to the pig and told him, "There's a rat trap in the house, a rat trap in the house!" "I am so very sorry Mr. Rat," sympathized the pig, "but there is nothing I can do about it but pray. Be assured that you are in my prayers."The rat turned to the cow. She said, "Like wow, Mr. Rat. a rat trap. I am in grave danger. Duh?"So the rat returned to the house, head down and dejected, to face the farmer's rat trap alone. That very night a sound was heard throughout the house, like the sound of a rat trap catching its prey. The farmer's wife rushed to see what was caught. In the darkness, she did not see that it was a venomous snake whose tail the trap had caught. The snake bit the farmer's wife. The farmer rushed her to the hospital. She returned home with a fever.Now everyone knows you treat a fever with fresh chicken soup, so the farmer took his hatchetto the barnyard for the soup's main ingredient. His wife's sickness continued so that friends and neighbors came to sit with her around the clock. To feed them the farmer butchered the pig.The farmer's wife did not get well. She died, and so many people came for her funeral that the farmer had the cow slaughtered to provide meat for all of them to eat.Literary Criticism using using Moralist approach.1.IntroductionTitle:Author:II.Body (Summary)III.

                                            Manila, Philippines - On the day her husband was arrested, Bernadeth Caboboy had 200 Philippine pesos (about $4) in her pocket and her fidgety three-year-old daughter in her arms. The toddler needed milk and they needed food, but had no money to buy either.It had been three weeks since the lockdown to curb the spread of COVID-19 was declared, and 21 long days since operations at the construction site where her husband worked had stopped.Their neighbourhood of San Roque in Quezon City, the country's largest metropolis, got neither food nor aid from the government. Caboboy's husband, Jek-Jek, decided to meet his foreman to see if he could get his salary.When Jek-Jek went out, he was swept up in a throng of people who were waiting for the rumoured distribution of relief goods"Someone shouted that a charity was going to give away a half-sack of rice," JekJek recalled. "People started lining up on the side of the road. The next thing I knew, the police came, telling us to get on the ground."Jek-Jek and 20 other residents of San Roque were arrested on April 1 and charged with violating quarantine protocol, disobedience and illegal assembly.Footage of police with riot shields and batons violently dispersing the crowd went viral. Concerned citizens put together 367,500 pesos ($7,350) to bail out the San Roque 21 after five days in detention.Critics warn that the Philippine government's heavy-handed approach to the public health emergency is criminalizing the poor for violating quarantine protocols that are impossible for them to follow, quashing their legitimate pleas for food and economic aid, and putting them at risk of infection in cramped detention centers."While they were in police custody, there was no social distancing. There were no proper hygiene facilities or supplies. Doesn't their arrest defeat the purpose of stopping the spread of the virus?" said Kristina Conti of the National Union of People's Lawyers (NUPL) and lawyer for the San Roque 21. Questions:1.

                            7. Directions: Identify what Literary Criticism is applicable to the following. (STRUCTURALISM, MORAL CRITICISM, MARXISM, FEMINISM, HISTORICAL APPROACH, READER-RESPONSE APPROACH)____________________1. The bible teaches us the value of forgiveness through the parable of The Prodigal Son, wherein the son asked for his inheritance from his father and left. He wasted all his inheritance and came back to his father empty-handed. He expected that he would have to beg for his father to take him back despite what he did. To his surprise, he was warmly welcomed by his father without hesitation. He was forgiven despite all his mistakes.____________________2. In the story of Cinderella, the Prince came from a rich family of royalties while Cinderella is just a poor commoner. Cinderella’s stepmother believes that she is not fit for the Prince because they live in two separate worlds of the rich and the poor.____________________3. The novel, Animal Farm, written by George Orwell was published in 1945. This novel is an allegory - even though it is set on a farm and stars a cast of farm animals, it reflects the events of the Russian revolution of 1917. The animals are all clever representations of Russian politicians, voters and workers. Orwell used the novel to make his opinions on Russian leaders. He couldn’t blatantly attack these leaders in his writings because of the censorship that British Media imposed during the 1940s just to get support from Soviet Union, so he allegorically criticized them using The Animal Farm. During the censorship, anti-Stalin and anti-Soviet writings were put on hold and were never published in Great Britain.____________________4. On June 17, 2018, workers at NurtiAsia Philippines went on a strike against low wages and unhealthy working conditions. The workers also alleged that NutriAsia practiced contractualization -- extending regular employment agreements to less than 10 percent of its 1,400-person workforce. The protest resulted in violent dispersal of the workers and on July 5 of the same year, Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) ordered NutriAsia to regularize 80 contractual workers.____________________5. The Autobiography of Veronica Franco, an Italian poet and a courtesan (sex worker in Renaissance Italy) talks about her struggles as a woman to gain a spot in the world of literature dominated mostly by men of nobility. She was labeled as an ‘honest courtesan’ for she fully disclosed in her autobiography her sexual relationships with intellectuals, noble men, and even with Kings. She used her social status as a courtesan to establish a name in literature because at that time, women did not have much voice in the society. What Veronica did was discuss and expose sexual issues, and for that, she was attacked by some of her male acquaintances for her boldness because men expected women to be reserved during that era.​</h2><br />

                            9. The Rat Trap (Author Unknown)A rat looked through a crack in the wall to see the farmer and his wife opening a package. What food might it contain? He was aghast to discover that it was a rat trap. Retreating to the barnyard the rat proclaimed the warning: "There's a rat trap in the house, a rat trap in the house!"The chicken clucked and scratched, raised her head and said, "Excuse me, Mr. Rat, I can tell this is a grave concern to you, but it is of no consequence to me. I cannot be bothered by it." The rat turned to the pig and told him, "There's a rat trap in the house, a rat trap in the house!" "I am so very sorry Mr. Rat," sympathized the pig, "but there is nothing I can do about it but pray. Be assured that you are in my prayers."The rat turned to the cow. She said, "Like wow, Mr. Rat. a rat trap. I am in grave danger. Duh?"So the rat returned to the house, head down and dejected, to face the farmer's rat trap alone. That very night a sound was heard throughout the house, like the sound of a rat trap catching its prey. The farmer's wife rushed to see what was caught. In the darkness, she did not see that it was a venomous snake whose tail the trap had caught. The snake bit the farmer's wife. The farmer rushed her to the hospital. She returned home with a fever.Now everyone knows you treat a fever with fresh chicken soup, so the farmer took his hatchetto the barnyard for the soup's main ingredient. His wife's sickness continued so that friends and neighbors came to sit with her around the clock. To feed them the farmer butchered the pig.The farmer's wife did not get well. She died, and so many people came for her funeral that the farmer had the cow slaughtered to provide meat for all of them to eat.Literary Criticism using using Moralist approach.1.IntroductionTitle:Author:II.Body (Summary)III.

                            13. Manila, Philippines - On the day her husband was arrested, Bernadeth Caboboy had 200 Philippine pesos (about $4) in her pocket and her fidgety three-year-old daughter in her arms. The toddler needed milk and they needed food, but had no money to buy either.It had been three weeks since the lockdown to curb the spread of COVID-19 was declared, and 21 long days since operations at the construction site where her husband worked had stopped.Their neighbourhood of San Roque in Quezon City, the country's largest metropolis, got neither food nor aid from the government. Caboboy's husband, Jek-Jek, decided to meet his foreman to see if he could get his salary.When Jek-Jek went out, he was swept up in a throng of people who were waiting for the rumoured distribution of relief goods"Someone shouted that a charity was going to give away a half-sack of rice," JekJek recalled. "People started lining up on the side of the road. The next thing I knew, the police came, telling us to get on the ground."Jek-Jek and 20 other residents of San Roque were arrested on April 1 and charged with violating quarantine protocol, disobedience and illegal assembly.Footage of police with riot shields and batons violently dispersing the crowd went viral. Concerned citizens put together 367,500 pesos ($7,350) to bail out the San Roque 21 after five days in detention.Critics warn that the Philippine government's heavy-handed approach to the public health emergency is criminalizing the poor for violating quarantine protocols that are impossible for them to follow, quashing their legitimate pleas for food and economic aid, and putting them at risk of infection in cramped detention centers."While they were in police custody, there was no social distancing. There were no proper hygiene facilities or supplies. Doesn't their arrest defeat the purpose of stopping the spread of the virus?" said Kristina Conti of the National Union of People's Lawyers (NUPL) and lawyer for the San Roque 21. Questions:1.

His parents pleaded with him to clean out his room.“What use is a fish tank with a hole in the bottom?” his father asked.

When he reached it, he discovered to his grief that it contained so little water that he could not possibly get at it. He tried everything he could think of to reach the water, but all his efforts were in vain. At last, he collected as many stones as he could carry and dropped them one by one with his beak into the pitcher, until he brought the water within his reach and thus saved his life.1.
