(Refrain) Bridge: Not death, not life, none on earth or above Will ever separate us from your love May we taste and see your goodness In the breaking of the bread Pledge of future hope and glory Of our rising from the dead.

tagalog</h2><br />
                        <p>Tagalog:</p><p>Alam kong malaki ang mundong ito
</p><p>At ang lahat ay tila hindi maaabot
</p><p>Mataas ang langit at malawak ang lakad
</p><p>Hindi mo lang alam kung ano ang mayroon ka pa sa iyong palad
</p><p>Nasa harap mismo ng kinatatayuan mo Kung naniniwala ka, ang lahat ng iyong pinapangarap, ay magkatotoo
</p><p>Kung maaari kang magmahal kahit gaano ka nasasaktan, ang Pag-ibig ay darating sa iyo, pabalik sa iyo.
</p><p>Ang mundong ito ay sa iyo
</p><p>
</p><p>Sa mga oras na alam kong magiging mahirap
</p><p>Kapag sa tingin mo hindi ka maaaring magpatuloy
</p><p>Ngunit mayroong isang plano para sa iyo hayaan lamang na sundin ang iyong puso
</p><p>Teka, ipinapangako kong magagawa mo ang lahat
</p><p>Sanhi kapag nahulog ka maaari mong laging magsimula muli
</p><p>Ang iyong hinaharap na karapatan sa harap ng kung saan ka nakatayo Kung naniniwala ka, lahat ng iyong pinapangarap, ay magkatotoo
</p><p>Kung maaari kang magmahal kahit gaano ka nasasaktan, ang Pag-ibig ay darating sa iyo, pabalik sa iyo.
</p><p>Ang mundong ito ay iyoMag-isang isang bundok
</p><p>Tumawid sa karagatan
</p><p>Maglayag sa ilog hanggang sa magbukas ito
</p><p>Gumawa ng mabuting kaibigan, makinig ng mabuti
</p><p>Hayaan ito, at sumayaw sa.
</p><p>
</p><p>Kung naniniwala ka, lahat ng iyong pinapangarap, ay magkatotoo
</p><p>Kung nakikita mo na walang maaaring maging sobrang malaki para sa iyo
</p><p>Kung maaari mong makita, kung maaari kang maniwala, kung maaari kang mangarap
</p><p>Ang mundong ito ay sa iyo
</p><p>Ang mundong ito ay sa iyo</p><p></p><p>English:</p><p>I know this world seems so big
</p><p>And everything seems so out of reach
</p><p>The sky is high and the walk is wide
</p><p>You've just don't know what you've got yetIt's in the palm of your hands
</p><p>It's right in front of where you standIf you believe, everything you dream, will come true
</p><p>If you can love no matter how you hurt, Love will come to you, back to you.
</p><p>This world is yours
</p><p>
</p><p>At times I know it's going to be hard
</p><p>When you think you can't go on
</p><p>But there's a plan for you just let your heart follow through
</p><p>Come on, I promise you can do it all
</p><p>Cause when you fall you can always start again
</p><p>Your future's right in front of where you standIf you believe, everything you dream, will come true
</p><p>If you can love no matter how you hurt, Love will come to you, back to you.
</p><p>This world is yoursClimb a mountain
</p><p>Cross the ocean
</p><p>Sail the river until it opens
</p><p>Make good friends, listen hard
</p><p>Let it out, and dance on.
</p><p>
</p><p>If you believe, everything you dream, will come true
</p><p>If you can see there's nothing that can be too big for you
</p><p>If you can see, if you can believe, if you can dream
</p><p>This world is yours
</p><p>This world is yours

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>everyone everywhere is in a pretty strange spot right now due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and we’re all dealing with it the best that we can. For most of us, that primarily means staying home and washing our hands often, for at least 20 seconds, to flatten the curve and keep ourselves and our communities as safe as we can.</p><p>For others, it means putting out some sweet, sweet coronavirus-themed jams. (And also the part about staying home and handwashing, those are still important).</p><p>Musicians the world over are recording songs that capture the strangeness and urgency of this moment in time and teach people how to stay safe and protect others. The first COVID-19 song many heard, including my coworkers and me, way back when we were still meeting in the office, came via Last Week Tonight with John Oliver. It did not disappoint.</p><br />

The singer itself wanted to remind people and herself the mean voices in our heads that keep saying we aren’t good enough and that we can’t do it, or it’s too late, are not actually true.

I do agree with the message being portrayed in the song because a lot of people or maybe most of the people also experience of giving up.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Run the World (Girls)" is a song recorded by American singer Beyoncé, from her fourth studio album 4 (2011), released as the lead single from the album on April 21, 2011. It was written by Terius "The-Dream" Nash and Beyoncé, while heavily sampling "Pon de Floor" by Major Lazer written by Nick "Afrojack" van de Wall, Wesley "Diplo" Pentz, David "Switch" Taylor and Adidja "Vybz Kartel" Palmer. Production was handled by Switch, The-Dream, Beyoncé, and Shea Taylor. The song's development was motivated by Beyoncé wanting to do something different: a mixture of different cultures and eras, a new sound, and a message which would give women strength. An unedited demo of the song, then thought to be titled "Girls (Who Run the World)", was leaked on the internet on April 18, 2011. "Run the World" premiered on US radio on April 21, 2011, and was digitally released the same day.</p><br />
