Homework is an important part of the learning process in Junior High School. One reason is that homework (1)gives students additional practice of skills covered in class. Junior High School classes are too short to teach a (2)new concept and practice it (3)sufficiently for students to master. Students need both guided practice in class and (4)independent practice at home. Another reason for homework is that it provides time to complete longer assignments. For example, the ideal composition process (5)allows time for students to think and to reflect on their ideas, as well as time to revise and to proofread their writing. Also, reports and special projects often require research that cannot always be done at school. In addition, since all students do not work at the same speed, giving students time at home to finish work keeps them from falling behind. Finally, the most important reason for homework is that it ensures review. New material and (6)old material are practiced in (7)daily assignments. Students who do their homework daily are prepared for tests and make better grades. In conclusion, not only is homework essential to mastering new skills and maintaining (8)previously learned skills, but it also (9)guarantees constant review and provides time for longer assignments, as well as additional time for students who need it. Students, do your daily homework, make (10)better grades, and learn more!</a>

Homework is an important part of the learning process in Junior High School. One reason is that homework (1) gives students additional practice of skills covered in class. Junior High School classes are too short to teach a (2) new concept and practice it (3)sufficiently for students to master. Students need both guided practice in class and (4)independent practice at home. Another reason for homework is that it provides time to complete longer assignments. For example, the ideal composition process (5)allows time for students to think and to reflect on their ideas, as well as time to revise and to proofread their writing. Also, reports and special projects often require research that cannot always be done at school. In addition, since all students do not work at the same speed, giving students time at home to finish work keeps them from falling behind. Finally, the most important reason for homework is that it ensures review. New material and (6) old material are practiced in (7)daily assignments. Students who do their homework daily are prepared for tests and make better grades. In conclusion, not only is homework essential to mastering new skills and maintaining (8)previously learned skills, but it also (9)guarantees constant review and provides time for longer assignments, as well as additional time for students who need it. Students, do your daily homework, make (10)better grades, and learn more!1.

                                            Identify whether the numbered word is a verb, adjective, or adverb. Tick your answer below. Homework is an important part of the learning process in Junior High School. One reason is that homework (1) gives students additional practice of skills covered in class. Junior High School classes are too short to teach a (2) new concept and practice it (3)sufficiently for students to master. Students need both guided practice in class and (4)independent practice at home. Another reason for homework is that it provides time to complete longer assignments. For example, the ideal composition process (5)allows time for students to think and to reflect on their ideas, as well as time to revise and to proofread their writing. Also, reports and special projects often require research that cannot always be done at school. In addition, since all students do not work at the same speed, giving students time at home to finish work keeps them from falling behind. Finally, the most important reason for homework is that it ensures review. New material and (6) old material are practiced in (7)daily assignments. Students who do their homework daily are prepared for tests and make better grades. In conclusion, not only is homework essential to mastering new skills and maintaining (8)previously learned skills, but it also (9)guarantees constant review and provides time for longer assignments, as well as additional time for students who need it. Students, do your daily homework, make (10)better grades, and learn more!

Wha Ecology Club Finds Gold in Garbage Good morning! This is the Great Discovery Integrated School News Center. For our news "Ecology Club Members Find Gold in Garbage" A group of students from the Ecology Club of Great Discovery Integrated School in Cavite ventured on a project to protect the environment through waste segregation. This was the result of their overnight stay at the Center for Ecozoic Living and Learning (CELL) in Silang, Cavite. The Ecology Club members aimed to reduce the solid waste generated by students and maintain the cleanliness of their surroundings. "We want to help lessen the volume of trash in our school. Shane Frias, the club president said, "Through our club, we will make the GDIS students know the importance of waste segregation," she further explained. They began the project after talking to the students during the general assembly. The students were made responsible for the segregation in the school canteen and the gym. There were trash bags allotted for biodegradable, non-biodegradable, plastics, and bottles. Club members regularly collected the garbage and sorted them out for disposal. The club earned an initial P 8,400.00 and they projected a bigger amount in the future. When asked about what they would do with their money, they said, “We have no idea yet, but we will coordinate with the Student Coordinating Organization for humanitarian projects." "If Mother Earth could speak, probably she would say, “Keep up the good work, kids." Here ends our news for today. This is Vincent, reporting from GDIS News Center. Good day and God bless!​</a>

Homework is an important part of the learning process in Junior High School. One reason is that homework (1)gives students additional practice of skills covered in class. Junior High School classes are too short to teach a (2)new concept and practice it (3)sufficiently for students to master.

In addition, since all students do not work at the same speed, giving students time at home to finish work keeps them from falling behind. Finally, the most important reason for homework is that it ensures review. New material and (6)old material are practiced in (7)daily assignments. Students who do their homework daily are prepared for tests and make better grades. In conclusion, not only is homework essential to mastering new skills and maintaining (8)previously learned skills, but it also (9)guarantees constant review and provides time for longer assignments, as well as additional time for students who need it.

Homework is an important part of the learning process in Junior High School. One reason is that homework (1) gives students additional practice of skills covered in class. Junior High School classes are too short to teach a (2) new concept and practice it (3)sufficiently for students to master. Students need both guided practice in class and (4)independent practice at home. Another reason for homework is that it provides time to complete longer assignments. For example, the ideal composition process (5)allows time for students to think and to reflect on their ideas, as well as time to revise and to proofread their writing. Also, reports and special projects often require research that cannot always be done at school. In addition, since all students do not work at the same speed, giving students time at home to finish work keeps them from falling behind. Finally, the most important reason for homework is that it ensures review. New material and (6) old material are practiced in (7)daily assignments. Students who do their homework daily are prepared for tests and make better grades. In conclusion, not only is homework essential to mastering new skills and maintaining (8)previously learned skills, but it also (9)guarantees constant review and provides time for longer assignments, as well as additional time for students who need it. Students, do your daily homework, make (10)better grades, and learn more!

This was the result of their overnight stay at the Center for Ecozoic Living and Learning (CELL) in Silang, Cavite. The Ecology Club members aimed to reduce the solid waste generated by students and maintain the cleanliness of their surroundings. "We want to help lessen the volume of trash in our school. Shane Frias, the club president said, "Through our club, we will make the GDIS students know the importance of waste segregation," she further explained. They began the project after talking to the students during the general assembly. The students were made responsible for the segregation in the school canteen and the gym. There were trash bags allotted for biodegradable, non-biodegradable, plastics, and bottles. Club members regularly collected the garbage and sorted them out for disposal. The club earned an initial P 8,400.00 and they projected a bigger amount in the future. When asked about what they would do with their money, they said, “We have no idea yet, but we will coordinate with the Student Coordinating Organization for humanitarian projects." "If Mother Earth could speak, probably she would say, “Keep up the good work, kids." Here ends our news for today. This is Vincent, reporting from GDIS News Center.
