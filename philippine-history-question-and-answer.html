studying history. Write an essay dealing with Rizal’s study of history. Use the following guide questions in
writing you essay (do not answer the questions one by one). What can we learn from Rizal’s work on
Morga’s book? What may we deduce from Rizal’s work considering that Rizal wrote them very early on
when there was no Philippines or Filipino to speak of yet? How did Rizal contribute to the study of the
Philippines and its history? Do you recognize Rizal’s annotations in some history books today? What can

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1The culture of the Philippines, an island country in the South-East Asia, represents a huge range of very outstanding and fascinating traditions. Nevertheless, for anyone who would like to discuss the issue of the Filipino contemporary theatre, the difficult and very complicated postcolonial history of the country appears as one of the main challenges. The Philippines were first colonized by Spain (1565-1898) and later (in the 20th century) by the USA. People in the Philippines used to say that they had spent 350 years in the convent and 50 years in Hollywood. But as long as we can speak about a strong influence, which both of those countries had on the Filipino nation and culture, we cannot forget that we can never speak about the entire removal of local traditions and aesthetics.</p><p></p><p>aw8 sa 50pts mo te</p><br />

Answer; The materials that come out of the volcano when it erupts are the and 4. Name at least 5 active volcanoes or those with eruptive history in the Philippines, Answer: ​</h2><br />
                        Earthquakes are usually caused when rock underground suddenly breaks along a fault. This sudden release of energy causes the seismic waves that make the ground shake. When two blocks of rock or two plates are rubbing against each other, they stick a little. They don't just slide smoothly; the rocks catch on each other.There are two types of earthquakes: tectonic and volcanic earthquakes. Tectonic earthquakes are produced by sudden movement along faults and plate boundaries.Volcanic eruptions produce three types of materials: gas, lava, and fragmented debris called tephra.There are about 300 volcanoes in the Philippines. Twenty-two (22) of these are active while the larger percentage remains dormant as of the record. The majority of the active volcanoes are located in the island of Luzon. The six most active volcanoes are Mayon, Hibok-Hibok, Pinatubo, Taal, Kanlaon and Bulusan.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana makatulong po </p><br />
