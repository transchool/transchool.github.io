                        <p>An objective of a review engagement is <strong>reporting whether material modifications should be made to such financial statements to make them conform with generally accepted accounting principles</strong>. </p><p></p><p><strong>Limited assurance or negative engagements are other names for review engagements.</strong> After an accountant has completed an auditing of a company's financial statements, auditors undertake a review engagement. As a result, the auditor offers only a limited level of assurance regarding the correctness of the financial statements. The auditor conducts investigational and analytical review procedures throughout the engagement to give the moderate degree of assurance necessary to produce a negative assurance report.</p><p></p><p>The auditor details any findings that lead them to feel that one party's claim does not give a true and fair view in a <strong>negative assurance report</strong>. If the auditor learned anything during the engagement that led them to conclude that the financial statements do not give a true and fair perspective of the company or that they do not adhere to the relevant accounting standards, they are required to disclose it. Since a review engagement gives the target user less certainty than an audit engagement, they are very different from one another.</p><p></p><p>To learn more about review engagement, just click the link below:</p><p>brainly.ph/question/29173005</p><p></p><p>#SPJ4</p><br />
