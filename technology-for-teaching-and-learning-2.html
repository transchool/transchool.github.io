Traditional materials like printed books, chalk board, and flashcards are used in the classrooms before. On the other hand, technology like e- books, TV monitor, LCD projectors, laptops, cell phones, and other gadgets are utilized in today's classrooms. Another point of comparison is the method of teaching. Schools in the past were highly teacher-centered, so the students were passive. Nowadays, schools are learner-centered which means students are actively engaged in learning. No matter how similar and different the schools in the past and today are, what matters most is how effective learning takes place in both. 1. What are being compared in the text? A.

Write the results of your critical evaluation on the spaces provided. ABSTRACT The crucial role of language in the improvement of man’s critical thinking in this era of globalization, multiculturalism, knowledge explosion, or modern technology prodded several professionals, academicians, and graduate -school students to conduct research studies on language teaching and learning specifically, on language theories and pedagogical practices related to communicative approach and functional grammar. (Freeman &amp;Anderson, 2012).One modern grammar theory this study assumed as the theoretical underpinning of any language teaching and learning methodology that zeroes in on critical thinking, a higher -order thinking strategy that every nation in this contemporary world needs to progress economically and politically, is the SFG or System Functional Grammar. The results showed that the ideas behind the Systematic Functional Grammar were likewise the ones applied in language teaching and learning activities infusing critical thinking. The SFG concepts : (1) multi-functionality of clauses, (2) grammar structures linked with communicative functions, (3) interactive activities, (4) contextualized exercises, (5) stressed macro-function of language, (6) exercises giving wide latitude of choice and, (7) use of discourse as the dominant language structure would trigger off critical -thinking acts like: comparing, classifying, patterning, planning, critiquing, hypothesizing, and reasoning inductively or deductively. (Bloor 1995; Eggins 1994; Halliday 1994, 2004, 2009) Validating the impact of the SFG theory on developing excellent communicators and reasonable or logical thinkers for global progress is the contribution of this paper to the field of language teaching and learning.

Not having a privilege to have a gadgets or any technology learning tools  to study2. Not all students are equally capable of absorbing information 3. Gather misinformation4. The problem is that the proliferation of multimedia in schools has disrupter traditional teaching methods and educational practices. This has raised concerns among educators and parents about the potential negative effects on students, such as reduced attention spans and decreased ability to process and retain information. It has also raised questions about the role of technology in education and the need for a balance between traditional and modern methods of teaching. (Need lang irevise)​</a>

Also, the extent of the effect may be dampened by the level of capability of teachers to use digital learning tools and resources effectively to achieve learning outcomes. More effective use of digital teaching to raise attainment includes the ability of teachers to identify how digital tools and resources can be used to achieve learning outcomes and adapting their approach, as well as having knowledge and understanding of the technology. This applies in all schools.Where learners use digital learning at home as well as school for formal and non-formal learning activities these have positive effects on their attainment, because they have extended their learning time. This is particularly important for secondary age learners.The assessment framework, set out in Annex 2, identifies a number of educational benefits that digital learning and teaching has the potential to help learners aged 5 to 18 to realise, through the opportunity to learn in different ways, access more sources of information, and be tested and get feedback differently. In terms of raising attainment, these benefits include short term outcomes, such as having a greater feeling of control over learning and more confidence to practise a skill, through to medium term outcomes such as faster acquisition of knowledge and skills, and improved impacts in terms of learners achieving higher exam or test results where digital technology has been used.In this section, the impact of digital technology on children's attainment in a range of areas is discussed, followed by the impact on aspects of numeracy, literacy and science learning.Raising children's attainmentThere is a substantial body of research that has examined the impact of digital tools and resources on children's attainment in a range of areas.Higgins et al (2012) provide a summary of research findings from studies with experimental and quasi-experimental designs, which have been combined in meta-analyses to assess the impact of digital learning in schools. Their search identified 48 studies which synthesised empirical research of the impact of digital tools and resources on the attainment of school age learners (5-18 year olds).They found consistent but small positive associations between digital learning and educational outcomes. For example, Harrison et al (2004) identified statistically significant findings, positively associating higher levels of ICT use with school achievement at each Key Stage in England, and in English, maths, science, modern foreign languages and design technology. Somekh et al (2007) identified a link between high levels of ICT use and improved school performance. They found that the rate of improvement in tests in English at the end of primary education was faster in ICT Test Bed education authorities in England than in equivalent comparator areas. However, Higgins et al note that while these associations show, on average, schools with higher than average levels of ICT provision also have learners who perform slightly higher than average, it may be the case that high performing schools are more likely to be better equipped or more prepared to invest in technology or more motivated to bring about improvement.Higgins et al report that in general analyses of the impact of digital technology on learning, the typical overall effect size is between 0.3 and 0.4 - just slightly below the overall average for researched interventions in education (Sipe &amp; Curlette, 1997; Hattie, 2008) and no greater than other researched changes to teaching to raise attainment, such as peer tutoring or more focused feedback to learners. The range of effect sizes is also very wide (-0.03 to 1.05),which suggests that it is essential to take into account the differences between technologies and how they are used.​</a>

Elaborate the statements. 4.How does values developed and what influences its development? 5.Why Philippine Value system degrades as time passed by?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1. Values play a significant role in making a house into a home. They provide a sense of identity and belonging for the people who live there. A house that is infused with positive values creates a positive and nurturing environment for its inhabitants. On the other hand, a house that lacks values or has negative values can create a negative and toxic atmosphere. To make a house into a home, it is important to identify and cultivate values that align with one's personal beliefs and goals. These values should be reflected in the daily habits and routines of the people living in the home, as well as in the overall atmosphere and decor of the space.</p><p></p><p>2. Technology can change the way we communicate and interact with each other. It can also alter the way we access and share information. Some people may value convenience and efficiency over privacy.</p><p>Others may place a higher value on traditional ways of living. The impact of technology on values varies among individuals and societies.</p><p></p><p>3. Different children learn in different ways. Some may be visual learners, while others may be auditory learners. It is important to identify a child's learning style and tailor teaching methods accordingly. This can increase the child's engagement and understanding of the material. Failing to adapt to a child's learning style may result in frustration and decreased motivation.</p><p></p><p>4. Values can be influenced by family, culture, and life experiences. Early childhood experiences and role models can shape a person's values. Social interactions and group membership can also influence values. Personal goals and beliefs can also play a role in the development of values.</p><p>As a person grows and experiences new things, their values may change and evolve.</p><p></p><p>5. The Philippine Value system has degraded over time because of the increased influence of Western culture, the rise of materialism, the weakening of family relations, the rise of individualism, and the erosion of traditional values and beliefs. The traditional values that were once passed down from generation to generation have been replaced by the modern values of consumerism, materialism, and selfishness. The newer generation has embraced the values of instant gratification, convenience, and pleasure-seeking, which has caused them to neglect the importance of community, family and faith. Additionally, the lack of proper education and guidance for young people has also been a factor in the degradation of the Philippine Value system. Finally, the increasing influence of the media and social media has caused many to lose touch with their Filipino identity, which has further weakened the traditional values and beliefs of the country.</p><br />

Write the results of your critical evaluation on the spaces provided. ABSTRACT The crucial role of language in the improvement of man’s critical thinking in this era of globalization, multiculturalism, knowledge explosion, or modern technology prodded several professionals, academicians, and graduate -school students to conduct research studies on language teaching and learning specifically, on language theories and pedagogical practices related to communicative approach and functional grammar. (Freeman &amp;Anderson, 2012).One modern grammar theory this study assumed as the theoretical underpinning of any language teaching and learning methodology that zeroes in on critical thinking, a higher -order thinking strategy that every nation in this contemporary world needs to progress economically and politically, is the SFG or System Functional Grammar. The results showed that the ideas behind the Systematic Functional Grammar were likewise the ones applied in language teaching and learning activities infusing critical thinking. The SFG concepts : (1) multi-functionality of clauses, (2) grammar structures linked with communicative functions, (3) interactive activities, (4) contextualized exercises, (5) stressed macro-function of language, (6) exercises giving wide latitude of choice and, (7) use of discourse as the dominant language structure would trigger off critical -thinking acts like: comparing, classifying, patterning, planning, critiquing, hypothesizing, and reasoning inductively or deductively. (Bloor 1995; Eggins 1994; Halliday 1994, 2004, 2009) Validating the impact of the SFG theory on developing excellent communicators and reasonable or logical thinkers for global progress is the contribution of this paper to the field of language teaching and learning. Evaluation:​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>The abstract of this research paper appears to be in keeping with the concepts of abstract writing in that it provides a clear overview of the research study and its findings. It clearly states the purpose of the study, which is to investigate the role of language in improving critical thinking through the use of the Systematic Functional Grammar (SFG) theory. The abstract also includes a summary of the key findings, which is that the SFG concepts and language teaching and learning activities can trigger critical thinking skills such as comparing, classifying, patterning, and reasoning. Finally, the abstract specifies the contribution of the paper to the field of language teaching and learning, which is the validation of the impact of the SFG theory on developing excellent communicators and logical thinkers for global progress.</strong></p><br />

Also, the extent of the effect may be dampened by the level of capability of teachers to use digital learning tools and resources effectively to achieve learning outcomes. More effective use of digital teaching to raise attainment includes the ability of teachers to identify how digital tools and resources can be used to achieve learning outcomes and adapting their approach, as well as having knowledge and understanding of the technology. This applies in all schools.Where learners use digital learning at home as well as school for formal and non-formal learning activities these have positive effects on their attainment, because they have extended their learning time. This is particularly important for secondary age learners.The assessment framework, set out in Annex 2, identifies a number of educational benefits that digital learning and teaching has the potential to help learners aged 5 to 18 to realise, through the opportunity to learn in different ways, access more sources of information, and be tested and get feedback differently. In terms of raising attainment, these benefits include short term outcomes, such as having a greater feeling of control over learning and more confidence to practise a skill, through to medium term outcomes such as faster acquisition of knowledge and skills, and improved impacts in terms of learners achieving higher exam or test results where digital technology has been used.In this section, the impact of digital technology on children's attainment in a range of areas is discussed, followed by the impact on aspects of numeracy, literacy and science learning.Raising children's attainmentThere is a substantial body of research that has examined the impact of digital tools and resources on children's attainment in a range of areas.Higgins et al (2012) provide a summary of research findings from studies with experimental and quasi-experimental designs, which have been combined in meta-analyses to assess the impact of digital learning in schools. Their search identified 48 studies which synthesised empirical research of the impact of digital tools and resources on the attainment of school age learners (5-18 year olds).They found consistent but small positive associations between digital learning and educational outcomes. For example, Harrison et al (2004) identified statistically significant findings, positively associating higher levels of ICT use with school achievement at each Key Stage in England, and in English, maths, science, modern foreign languages and design technology. Somekh et al (2007) identified a link between high levels of ICT use and improved school performance. They found that the rate of improvement in tests in English at the end of primary education was faster in ICT Test Bed education authorities in England than in equivalent comparator areas. However, Higgins et al note that while these associations show, on average, schools with higher than average levels of ICT provision also have learners who perform slightly higher than average, it may be the case that high performing schools are more likely to be better equipped or more prepared to invest in technology or more motivated to bring about improvement.Higgins et al report that in general analyses of the impact of digital technology on learning, the typical overall effect size is between 0.3 and 0.4 - just slightly below the overall average for researched interventions in education (Sipe &amp; Curlette, 1997; Hattie, 2008) and no greater than other researched changes to teaching to raise attainment, such as peer tutoring or more focused feedback to learners. The range of effect sizes is also very wide (-0.03 to 1.05),which suggests that it is essential to take into account the differences between technologies and how they are used.​</h2><br />

Is it possible to use ICT in agricultural extension to improve agricultural marketing in developing countries like India?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The results indicate that ICT integration has a great effectiveness for both teachers and the students. Findings indicate that teachers' well-equipped preparation with ICT tools and facilities is one the main factors in success of technology-based teaching and learning.</p><p></p><p>2. In addition to being an important technology sector in its own right, information and communication technology (ICT) is important for linking agents in the innovation system. ... Commits to promote social innovation to support social well-being and sustainable livelihoods.</p><p></p><p>3. As a future educator, one way to overcome the barriers of online learning/teaching is to let the learners be aware of the current situation and the method used in teaching. In addition having mutual understanding to the learners can create connection to both the learners and the teachers.</p><p></p><p>4. Quantitative research methods emphasize objective measurements and the statistical, mathematical, or numerical analysis of data collected through polls, questionnaires, and surveys, or by manipulating pre-existing statistical data using computational techniques. Quantitative research focuses on gathering numerical data and generalizing it across groups of people or to explain a particular phenomenon.  The final written report has a set structure consisting of introduction, literature and theory, methods, results, and discussion.</p><p></p><p>5. It is not only an issue of possibility, it is highly important to utilize the ICT to grab the benefit and reach to the poor. In developing countries, there is group called middle-men who basically take the lion's share of profit that can minimized by using ICT where producers can easily opt for marketing. Moreover, ICT-induced fund transfer can be helpful for them. In some cases, India and Bangladesh are showing their success, which can be applicable for other developing countries too.</p><p></p><p>Correct me if I'm wrong!</p><p></p><br />
