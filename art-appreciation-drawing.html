                                            LESSON 2: ART IN THE PHILIPPINES
Filipino Arts are alive and well around the country!
But what exactly are these arts and how do they differ from each other? Who are some of the
notable artists in the Philippines?
Activity 3: The Art Journal
For these next lessons we are going to build your very own ART JOURNAL! As
we learn about the different kinds of art forms and become introduced to some of
our country’s greatest artists, you will build a small compilation of writings, images,
and thoughts to help you build a greater understanding and appreciation of art and
yourself as an artist.
You may use:
• A new or fresh notebook or journal
• A blog or vlog site
• Electronic format like Word document or PowerPoint
• Other mediums like cut outs, collages, or illustrations
• You may use newspapers, magazines, or even the internet
So let’s begin, as your first entry, answer this question:
When you hear the term “Filipino Art” or “Filipino Artists” what comes to mind? List
it down, show us, use words, pictures, drawings, whatever you want! Get creative!
This is your journal</a>

                            27. LESSON 2: ART IN THE PHILIPPINES
Filipino Arts are alive and well around the country!
But what exactly are these arts and how do they differ from each other? Who are some of the
notable artists in the Philippines?
Activity 3: The Art Journal
For these next lessons we are going to build your very own ART JOURNAL! As
we learn about the different kinds of art forms and become introduced to some of
our country’s greatest artists, you will build a small compilation of writings, images,
and thoughts to help you build a greater understanding and appreciation of art and
yourself as an artist.
You may use:
• A new or fresh notebook or journal
• A blog or vlog site
• Electronic format like Word document or PowerPoint
• Other mediums like cut outs, collages, or illustrations
• You may use newspapers, magazines, or even the internet
So let’s begin, as your first entry, answer this question:
When you hear the term “Filipino Art” or “Filipino Artists” what comes to mind? List
it down, show us, use words, pictures, drawings, whatever you want! Get creative!
This is your journal</h2><br />
